# Annotation Guide for Annotated Clinical Case Reports (ACCRs)

## Introduction
This Guide contains a list of data types identified in the process of assembling the ACCR data set, along with guidelines for what types of text or numerical values should be used in each type. We have arranged the types into four general categories: document and annotation indentification values, case report identification values (i.e., document-level properties), medical content concepts (for the most part, these are concept-level properties) and acknowledgements (i.e., text within each document linking it to other organizations and publications). 

As this guide primarily describes how to annotate clinical case reports, the data types listed here are those we have determined to be most descriptive for clinical case reports and patient-focused medical documents in general. Our goal is also to follow FAIR principles in establishing structure on case report text and have identified the corresponding principles in two of the categories provided below. We encourage using these data types to annotate new sets of documents and/or to build new ontologies.

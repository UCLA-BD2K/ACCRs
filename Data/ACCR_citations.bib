We hereby report a case of isolated COX deficiency manifesting with encephalomyopathy, hydrocephalus and hypertropic cardiomyopathy due to a missense p.R20C mutation in the COX6B1 gene, which encodes an integral, nuclear-encoded COX subunit. This novel mutation was predicted to be severe in silico. In accord, enzymatic activity was undetectable in muscle and fibroblasts, was severely decreased in lymphocytes and the COX6B1 protein was barely detectable in patient's muscle mitochondria. Complementation with the wild-type cDNA by a lentiviral construct restored COX activity, and mitochondrial function was improved by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, resveratrol and ascorbate in the patient's fibroblasts. We suggest that genetic analysis of COX6B1should be included in the investigation of isolated COX deficiency, including patients with cardiac defects. Initial measurement of COX activity in lymphocytes may be useful as it might circumvent the need for invasive muscle biopsy. The evaluation of ascorbate supplementation to patients with mutated COX6B1 is warranted.},

This report of an advanced inoperable primary pleural synovial sarcoma is the first to address the use of hyperthermia therapy in combination with chemoradiotherapy for this disease, together with radiological assessment following that therapy. Computed tomography performed after thermoradiation showed a decrease in tumor size and a characteristic unenhanced low-density area in the tumor suggesting that tumor necrosis resulted from the therapy. These image findings were helpful in assessing the tumor response to thermoradiation. We believe that hyperthermia therapy combined with chemoradiotherapy should be regarded as an option for advanced primary pleural synovial sarcoma. This would give computed tomography important role in evaluating this approach.},

Previous cytogenetic analyses of erythroid colonies obtained from BM cells of patients with Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) revealed that Ph-positive karyotypes were predominant in all 11 cases. Two of them were also examined in blastic phase (BP) and showed 100% Ph+ cells in BFU-E-derived colonies. The present findings suggest that the leukemic process of Ph+ ALL does not involve the erythroid series, which is in contrast to the involvement in CML. This is considered to be a fundamental difference between Ph+ ALL and the blastic phase of CML (BP CML). Clinically, cytogenetic analysis of erythroid colonies from BM cells may constitute a valuable approach for the differential diagnosis between Ph+ ALL and the BP of Ph+ CML.},

This paper reports the case of a 45-year-old man admitted to the emergency room with a diagnosis of new onset atrial fibrillation and CHF, whose past medical history was not significant except for a gunshot wound to his abdomen 22 years previously. The etiology of his CHF together with the cardiomegaly and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function was unknown. A subcostal view routinely done during transthoracic echocardiography revealed a severely dilated inferior vena cava and the presence of an aorto-caval fistula by color doppler. The patient underwent successful corrective repair with dramatic improvement in symptoms and resolution of the atrial fibrillation, and cardiac size returned to normal. This rare case emphasizes that patients with refractory CHF must be closely examined with particular attention to palpation and auscultation over all scars, irrespective of the duration since any traumatic or surgical event.},

We describe a case report of an 8-year old with recurrent episodes of acute uveitis that developed bilateral granulomatous panuveitis initially treated with topical and systemic steroids. Genetic testing for NOD2/CARD15 revealed a heterozygous mutation on exon 4 in the NBD domain (P268S/SNP5). Therefore, an incomplete EOS was suspected. Because uveitis worsening with multifocal chorioretinitis aggravation, intravenous boluses of methylprednisolone were administered. During the steroids tapering, she flared again, and methotrexate was started along with corticosteroids pulse therapy. However, new ocular granuloma appeared, macular oedema with poor visual outcome occurred, and therefore, adalimumab was added to MTX and steroids. After 6 months since the new therapy started, she had a complete visual recovery, and she was able to stop steroid treatment. At 2 years of follow-up, she is still in remission on treatment, and her visual acuity is normal. No side effects were observed. In our patient, we found a heterozygous mutation on exon 4 in the NBD domain (P268S/SNP5) of NOD2/CARD15 gene and an incomplete EOS was hypothesized. The role of this variant is currently under study. Adalimumab use dramatically changed the course of eye disease, prompting to stop steroid treatment and preserving visual acuity.},

In these cases, moreover, slightly high intensities were noted in the affected cerebellar cortices on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images.

However, no significant electrocardiographic changes were recognized. In addition to the cardiac dysfunction, the patient presented a marked tachypnea and dyspnea associated with hypoxemia. These were dramatically improved by methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg per day, for 3 days) and CMV high titer immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg per day, for 3 days). On the sixth day after signs of respiratory failure were improved, the patient suddenly presented a paroxysmal atrial tachycardia followed by a fatal ventricular fibrillation. Although we could detect neither a specific IgM antibody, a significant increase of IgG antibody, nor CMV genome by DNA hybridization techniques during the course of the illness, microscopic examination of necropsy specimens of the heart showed a marked disruption and disintegration of muscle bands associated with cytomegalic inclusion bodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yielded a 305 bp amplification product in the heart and lung tissues, supporting the view that myocarditis was caused by CMV.},

Metastasis to a mesocolic lymph node has not been reported previously. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis underwent primary resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Two and a half years later, tumor marker levels increased remarkably and imaging revealed a mesocolic mass. The tumor measured 27 mm in diameter and showed characteristic findings consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma in dynamic computed tomographic images, although the tumor was negative in fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic images. A preoperative diagnosis of solitary metastasis to a mesocolic lymph node was made, and we elected to perform surgical resection, although therapeutic strategies for rare solitary extrahepatic metastasis are controversial. The tumor was located in the mesocolon nearly at the wall of the descending colon. Curative resection was performed and histopathological analysis confirmed metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma to a mesocolic lymph node. Tumor marker levels normalized immediately postoperatively. To date, the patient remains free from recurrence without adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS This is the first known case of solitary hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis to a distant mesocolic lymph node, successfully treated. Diagnosing solitary hepatocellular carcinoma metastases to distant lymph nodes can be difficult. Although the ideal therapeutic approach has not be defined, surgical resection of solitary metastatic lymph nodes may be beneficial in carefully selected cases.},

These neutrophilic dermatosis (NDs) are distinguished by the existence of forms of transition or overlap. They are frequently associated to systemic diseases especially hematologic and gastrointestinal ones. We report a case of a patient with ulcerative colitis (UC) who successively developed two types of NDs: PG then SS. A 66 years old patient with a history of UC consulted in July 2012 for an erythematous swelling of the back of the right hand treated with antibiotics without improvement. At that time, bacteriological samples were negative. In October 2012, he was hospitalized for polyarthralgia and impaired general condition. In physical examination, he had vesiculobullous plaque of 10 cm long of the right hand and wrist, infiltrated erythematous plaque on the right leg and another topped with a large pustule at the left ankle. Skin biopsy showed at the back of the right hand an aspect of PG and at the infiltrated plaques of the ankle an aspect of SS. Prednisone was started with improvement of the skin lesions and a recovery condition. The combination of PG and SS has already been described in cases of hematologic malignancy and rarely in UC. There is also the notion of passage from a neutrophilic dermatosis to another. Indeed, a typical lesion initially of SS can evolve to a future PG. This case demonstrates that neutrophilic dermatoses form a continous spectrum of entities that may occur in UC.},

Two years ago, he was operated on in another hospital based on the wrong diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and subaortic membrane. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the existence of a PMV, which led to severe mitral stenosis through a previously implanted mitral annular ring. Other components of Shone's syndrome, subaortic membrane and aortic coarctation, together with PDA, were also observed. Another operation was suggested, but the patient refused. During the two year follow-up period, in spite of an atrial fibrillation attack and deteriorating dyspnea, the patient still did not want another operation. Once any of the four components of the Shone's complex is detected, clinicians must look for the presence of other lesions.},

Gallium scintigram showed marked uptake in the heart. Biopsy from a cervical lymph node confirmed the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma of T-cell origin. Diastolic heart failure remained after successful chemotherapy. Autopsy revealed pericarditis with severe adhesion of the pericardium and the epicardium.},

We describe the first case of vesico-adnexal fistula that developed after pelvic surgery, and it was successfully treated by transurethral embolization under fluoroscopic guidance. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 27-year-old woman with a history of hysterectomy. She presented to our institution with urethral discharge and a recurrent urinary tract infection. The cystogram showed a fistula tract connecting the urinary bladder and left adnexal cystic cavity. She was treated conservatively with antibiotics and prolonged Foley catheterization to allow for spontaneous closure of the fistula; however, conservative management failed. The patient was successfully treated with transurethral embolization of the tract under fluoroscopic guidance.

CONCLUSIONS Bacterial infections complicating influenza B infection may include organisms not commonly associated with the respiratory system, such as Escherichia coli. In addition, bacterial complications of influenza B infection may affect non-respiratory systems, including the genitourinary tract.},

Mutations in the genes encoding mitochondrial aaRSs have been associated with a wide spectrum of human mitochondrial diseases. Here we report the identification of pathogenic mutations (a partial genomic deletion and a highly conserved p. Asp325Tyr missense variant) in FARS2, the gene encoding mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, in a patient with early-onset epilepsy and isolated complex IV deficiency in muscle. The biochemical defect was expressed in myoblasts but not in fibroblasts and associated with decreased steady state levels of COXI and COXII protein and reduced steady state levels of the mt-tRNA(Phe) transcript. Functional analysis of the recombinant mutant p. Asp325Tyr FARS2 protein showed an inability to bind ATP and consequently undetectable aminoacylation activity using either bacterial tRNA or human mt-tRNA(Phe) as substrates. Lentiviral transduction of cells with wildtype FARS2 restored complex IV protein levels, confirming that the p.Asp325Tyr mutation is pathogenic, causing respiratory chain deficiency and neurological deficits on account of defective aminoacylation of mt-tRNA(Phe).},

Isolated complex II deficiency is one of the rarest oxidative phosphorylation disorders with mutations described in three structural subunits and one of the assembly factors; just one case is attributed to recessively inherited SDHD mutations. We report the pathological, biochemical, histochemical and molecular genetic investigations of a male neonate who had left ventricular hypertrophy detected on antenatal scan and died on day one of life. Subsequent postmortem examination confirmed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non-compaction. Biochemical analysis of his skeletal muscle biopsy revealed evidence of a severe isolated complex II deficiency and candidate gene sequencing revealed a novel homozygous c.275A>G, p.(Asp92Gly) SDHD mutation which was shown to be recessively inherited through segregation studies. The affected amino acid has been reported as a Dutch founder mutation p.(Asp92Tyr) in families with hereditary head and neck paraganglioma. By introducing both mutations into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we were able to confirm that the p.(Asp92Gly) mutation causes a more severe oxidative growth phenotype than the p.(Asp92Tyr) mutant, and provides functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of the patient's SDHD mutation. This is only the second case of mitochondrial complex II deficiency due to inherited SDHD mutations and highlights the importance of sequencing all SDH genes in patients with biochemical and histochemical evidence of isolated mitochondrial complex II deficiency.},

The reason for our patient's CGD was unusual, as revealed by the following in vitro findings in neutrophils and EBV-transformed B-cells: lack of flavocytochrome b(558) expression, restoration of significant ROM production after transduction with gp91-phox cDNA by a retrovirus vector, an 879G-->A, Trp289-->Stop mutation in one X chromosomal gp91-phox allele, a one-sided paternal X chromosome inactivation, as shown by a lyonization assay at the HUMARA locus, and the result of a dihydrorhodamine 123 flow cytometry assay revealing consistently that 1 in 2500 neutrophils produced ROM at normal levels. Our conclusion: A presumed autosomal form of CGD has been excluded. Instead, a spontaneous mutation in gp91-phox coinciding with an extreme X chromosome inactivation ratio resulted in X-linked CGD in this young woman.},

Atrophic gastritis with H. pylori infection and multiple adenocarcinoma foci in multiple hyperplastic polyps were found in the endoscopic and histological examinations. Enterochromaffin-like micronests and parietal cell protrusion in the background of the polyps suggested the existence of hypergastrinemia. The serum gastrin level was markedly high-10,206 pg/ml (normal range 37-172 pg/ml). The cause of this marked hypergastrinemia was not autoimmune gastritis and gastrinoma. After discontinuing PPI therapy and successful eradication of H. pylori, the serum gastrin level decreased to normal range. These findings indicate that hypergastrinemia may be caused by long-term PPI therapy in patients with H. pylori infection. This case suggests that hypergastrinemia may mediate gastric carcinogenesis in patients with H. pylori infection.},

DL is a tumorous process involving smooth muscle cells, mostly of the esophagus, but also of the tracheobronchial tree and the female genital tract.

We here present a 9-year-old boy who was admitted because of a newly diagnosed sensorineural deafness. He was born with cataracts and presented symptoms of dysphagia and bronchial irritation in the first year of life. Macroscopic hematuria was first noticed at 2 years during a febrile infection. Since early childhood the boy suffered from severe constipation. Taking together these symptoms, the diagnosis of Alport syndrome with diffuse leiomyomatosis (AS-DL) has to be considered.

The detection of specific autoantibodies has been statistically linked to different etiologies. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old African-American woman with hypertension and a past history of morbid obesity and uncontrolled diabetes status post gastric bypass four years prior to the visit (with significantly improved body mass index and hemoglobin A1c controlled at the time of the clinical encounter) presented to the office complaining of gradual onset of unsteadiness and recurrent falls for the past three years, as well as difficulties coordinating routine daily activities. The neurologic exam showed moderate dysarthria and ataxic gait with bilateral dysmetria and positive Romberg test. Routine laboratory test results were only remarkable for a mild elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and most laboratory and imaging tests for common causes of ataxia failed to demonstrate an etiology. Upon further workup, evidence of anti-voltage-gated calcium channel and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody was demonstrated. She was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulins with remarkable clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of antibody-mediated ataxia not associated with malignancy. While ataxia is rarely related to autoantibodies, in such cases it is critical to understand the etiology of this disabling condition in order to treat it correctly. Clinicians should be aware of the possible association with specific autoantibodies and the necessity to rule out an occult malignancy in such cases.},

Neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerves, MRC grade 4 power in the proximal and distal muscles of the limbs, and generalized areflexia. However, the sensory examination results, serum immunoelectrophoresis, anti-HIV antibody, and vitamins B1 and B12 levels were normal. Cervical MR imaging was unremarkable. Cerebrospinal fluid showed albuminocytologic dissociation. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated prolonged distal latencies in the bilateral median nerves and left ulnar nerve. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) infusion resulted in a marked improvement. Thereafter, the patient had been treated with repeated IVIg to maintain motor function. Subsequently, the patient fulfilled the EFNS/PNS diagnostic criteria for pure motor form of definite CIDP. Treatment with ciclosporin with the plasma trough level of 60-150 ng/ml reduced the frequency of IVIg. However, renal function began to deteriorate 94 months after the initiation of ciclosporin. The calcineurin inhibitor was replaced with mycophenolate mofetil 1,500 mg, which significantly increased the interval between infusions without further renal impairment. Therefore, mycophenolate may represent an effective alternative treatment for some IVIg-dependent CIDP patients.},

Neonatal bowel strangulation in CDH should be taken into account when estimating postnatal morbidity and mortality and, even if CDH treatment is not an emergency procedure, if gastrointestinal symptoms prevail over respiratory symptoms, surgery should be carried out without delay.},

Moreover, an appropriate clinical presentation is essential to the diagnosis and helps to favor or exclude inflammatory/reactive processes.

Several previous reports have documented reversible electrocardiographic changes during severe acute asthma attacks, including tachycardia, P pulmonale, right bundle branch block, right axis deviation, and ST segment and T wave abnormalities. CASE REPORT We present the case of a pregnant patient with asthma exacerbation in which acute bronchospasm caused S1Q3T3 abnormality on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The complete workup of ECG findings of S1Q3T3 was negative and correlated with bronchospasm. The S1Q3T3 electrocardiographic abnormality can be seen in acute bronchospasm in pregnant women. The other causes like pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, acute lung disease, cor pulmonale, and left posterior fascicular block were excluded. CONCLUSIONS Asthma exacerbations are of considerable concern during pregnancy due to their adverse effect on the fetus, and optimization of asthma treatment during pregnancy is vital for achieving good outcomes. Prompt recognition of electrocardiographic abnormality and early treatment can prevent adverse perinatal outcomes.},

No mutations in ATP2A2, ATP2C1 or keratin 5 genes were found both in the lesional skin and in peripheral leukocytes, suggesting that putative pathogenesis of Grover's disease is distinct from those of other acantholytic dermatoses. Electron microscopy revealed poorly developed tonofibrils in the basal cells, and the structure of desmosomes appeared normal, with an increase in the number of desmosomes in the spinous layer, indicating compensation of defective desmosomal function. Impairment of desmosomal plaque proteins linking tonofilaments to desmosomal cadherins may thus account for acantholysis. The unusual bilateral mosaic arrangement in our patient may offer valuable clues to the genetic basis of Grover's disease.},

    abstract = {The role of trigeminal ganglion percutaneous injection and radio-frequency lesioning procedures for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN) in multiple sclerosis (MS) is well established. There is general acceptance that microvascular decompression (MVD) cannot be an appropriate treatment due to the view that the underlying aetiology is a demyelinating plaque affecting the root entry zone of the trigeminal pathway. Recently, MR-imaging has been used in the preoperative investigation of this group of patients demonstrating that neurovascular compression can occasionally be the responsible mechanism and that MVD can be the treatment of choice. We present five cases with MS and TGN. All the patients had failed to respond to medical treatment or percutaneous procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated evidence of neurovascular compression in four cases. All the patients underwent MVD. Postoperatively four of the five patients made an uncomplicated recovery, were pain-free and fully satisfied with the result (mean follow-up 38.75 months; range 8-59 months). One patient developed recurrent pain 1 week following surgery and went on to have a total sensory rhizotomy. TGN in MS can be caused by neurovascular compression, which may be identified on MR-imaging. MVD has offered satisfactory short-term outcome for at least 2 years and does not inflict sensory loss. Longer follow-up will determine whether the outcome in MS patients will be as successful as in the TGN patients who do not suffer from MS.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Myocarditis, defined as inflammation of myocardial tissue of the heart, is an uncommon cardiac presentation and is due to a variety of causes. It affects 1% of the US population, 50% of which is caused by coxsackie B virus. Cardiac tissue is the prime target, and destruction of myocardium results in cardiac failure with fluid overload. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 57-year-old woman with fever, headache, neck pain, and generalized malaise. Her white blood cell count was 13×10³ cells/mm³. Interestingly, lumbar puncture ruled out meningitis. An echocardiogram to evaluate elevated troponin revealed an ejection fraction of 30% with severe left ventricular global hypokinesis without valvular vegetations consistent with new-onset systolic heart failure. Cardiac MRI showed a small pericardial effusion with bilateral pleural effusion. As she continued to be febrile, a viral panel was ordered, revealing coxsackie B4 antibody titer of 1: 640 (reference: >1: 32 indicates recent infection) with positive Epstein-Barr virus deoxyribonucleic acid by PCR, consistent with viral myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS Coxsackie B virus myocarditis is rarely recognized and reported by the general internist in clinical practice, so we would like present our experience with an interesting clinical presentation of the viral prodrome. An estimated 95% people in the US are infected with Epstein-Barr virus by adulthood, but it remains dormant in memory B lymphocytes. Recirculation of these B cells in lymphoid tissue stimulated by antigens, which in our case is coxsackie B virus; they differentiate into plasma cells, and the production of Z Epstein-Barr replication activator protein (ZEBRA) increases viral replication, thus explaining the positive EBV DNA measured by PCR.},

It is a rare congenital disease with a low prevalence of 1:50,000 - 100,000 live births p.a. The histopathology is characterized by villous atrophy and the characteristic epithelial tufts.

The improvement in LV performance was detected by Tissue Doppler (TD) and strain analysis, despite no changes in standard indices such as ejection fraction and Doppler pattern of mitral inflow. Color TD-derived myocardial velocity and deformation indices also revealed a reduction in intra-ventricular early diastolic asynchrony after therapy. In addition, an improvement in intra-ventricular systolic synchrony was detected by strain rate and strain, but not by color TD velocity imaging. These findings suggest that treatment with melphalan and dexamethasone may improve symptoms of heart failure and LV performance in subjects with cardiac amyloidosis, and that TD and particularly strain imaging could represent useful techniques to monitor the effect of therapy on LV function in the follow-up of these patients.},

To date, at 4 years of age, she presents a severe encephalopathy, increased INF-alpha in the CSF, and calcifications of basal ganglia on computerized tomography. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral and symmetric hypersignal of the posterior white matter. A complex I deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was found in skeletal muscle, which was associated with a complex IV deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. The question of whether this oxidative phosphorylation deficiency is primary or secondary in AGS is open to debate.

The treatment of HFpEF can be challenging due to a lack of evidence supporting the benefit of various drug therapies. In practice, treatment can be divided into acute and chronic management. Acute therapy for decompensated heart failure is similar for both HFpEF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The mainstay of treatment is diuretics to reduce volume overload and improve dyspnea. Patients with an acute exacerbation of HFpEF and rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) should be rate controlled with negative chronotropic agents. For chronic therapy, patients with HFpEF should not be treated like patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Chronic management of HFpEF can be simplified by using three strategies based on applicability: treat precipitating conditions (e.g., hypertension, AF), control symptoms by maintaining euvolemia with diuretics, and avoid therapies that have been shown not to be beneficial unless another compelling indication exists. Nondrug interventions for HFpEF include salt and fluid restriction, regular physical activity, and referral to a heart function clinic, if appropriate.},

Crescents are rare in primary membranous nephropathy and thus suggest another underlying disease process, such as combined membranous and focal or diffuse lupus nephritis. However, in some patients with membranous nephropathy and crescents, the crescentic lesion may be due to a distinct, separate disease process, such as anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.

Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed diffuse mesangial sclerosis, and mutational analysis was compatible with PLCE1 mutation. However, electron microscopic findings of renal tissue, sensorineural hearing loss, and other ocular and neurologic findings led us to suspect mitochondrial cytopathy. Muscle tissue analysis showed a deficiency of the respiratory chain complex IV. The clinical presentation of our patient is not typical for primary cytochrome oxidase (COX) deficiency but showed similarities with patients carrying AR mutations in COX10. This was the first case in the literature with both PLCE1 mutation and COX deficiency. We could not identify pathogenic mutations in the COX10 gene, suggesting that PLCE1 deficiency could be the cause of the secondary deficiency of COX. Another, more likely, possibility is that the mitochondriopathy phenotype is caused by another mutation homozygous by descent in a yet unidentified recessive gene.},

Its severity is mainly associated with an high risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Very few cases have been described mainly in African literature. We report the case of a 4-year old boy admitted with very abundant haematemesis, melena and dizziness associated with anemic syndrome on examination. Laboratory tests showed severe microcytic hypochromic anemia with normal renal and hepatic function. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed esophageal varices (grade III) with red signs. Abdominal ultrasound showed portal vein formation resulting in the classic "spiderweb", in favor of a cavernoma. Abdominal CT scan confirmed portal cavernoma associated with portal hypertensive syndrome and vascular anomaly like an ectopic splenic vein anastomosis with the trunk formed by the gonadal vein and the inferior mesenteric vein. Therapeutic approach was based on blood transfusion and beta-blocker treatment. Portal cavernoma can be a major complication of vascular malformations often unknown. In case of gastrointestinal haemorrhage in children, diagnosis should be suspected. Its management requires early treatment and should be adapted to the patient's condition in order to prevent a fatal evolution.},

This is also a new finding in association with both the liver and platelet diseases. The platelet aggregation deficit was transferable in the patient's serum rather than being intrinsic to the platelets.

At the age of 2 years, nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed and successfully treated with a standard prednisone regimen. Frequent relapses occurred. Treatment with oral cyclophosphamide followed by cyclosporine was successful, but several attempts to withdraw steroids failed and the patient suffered from multiple relapses. At the age of 12 years, renal biopsy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and cyclosporine toxicity. A second course of oral cyclophosphamide was unsuccessful and tacrolimus resulted in the development of diabetes mellitus, which was reversed after discontinuation of the drug. At the age of 15 years the patient, still being steroid dependent, developed ITP. Neither steroids nor intravenous immunoglobulins induced permanent remission. Only weekly immunoglobulin infusions could temporarily restore the platelet count. To treat ITP in this desperate situation we decided to deplete B-cells with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. Intravenous infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) were given once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks without adverse events. Four weeks after the first rituximab dosage, the thrombocyte count increased to normal values. There has been no subsequent relapse of either thrombocytopenia or nephrotic syndrome (on cyclosporine, without steroids) to date. We conclude that B-cell depletion with rituximab might have altered the course of steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome in our patient.},

Despite radical nephrectomy, the patient experienced an early local retroperitoneal recurrence associated with lung and liver metastases. The tumor did not respond to four successive lines of chemotherapy nor to palliative radiotherapy. Due to partial morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap with Ewing sarcoma, CIC-DUX4 positive tumors have generally been considered as Ewing-like sarcomas and managed similarly. However, this tumor shows a high propensity to metastasize and is much less sensitive to chemotherapy than Ewing sarcomas. The management of this type of very aggressive sarcoma needs to be defined by comprehensive biological and clinical studies.},

Multiple endocrine dysfunction associated with this syndrome was rarely reported. In this paper, the Authors report on a female patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome with large heteroplasmic mtDNA deletion, absence of cytochrome c oxidase in many muscle fibers, partial GH deficiency, hypothyroidism and subsequently insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Anti-thyroid peroxidase and antithyreoglobulin antibodies were present in high titer in serum while anti-islet cell antibodies were absent. The patient developed thyroiditis with Hashimoto encephalopathy. The presence of GH deficiency, autoimmune thyroiditis with hypothyroidism and IDDM distinguishes this case from others and confirms the association of Kearns-Sayre syndrome with multiple endocrine dysfunction. Hashimoto encephalopathy and anti-thyroideal antibodies suggest that in this patient, predisposed by a genetic factor (a mitochondrial deletion) anti-thyroideal antibodies may have contributed to the hypothyroidism and, by interfering with cerebral mitochondrial function, may have caused the encephalopathy. GH deficiency and IDDM can be attributed to oxidative phosphorylation deficiency but the autoimmunity may also have played a role in the production of glandular insufficiencies. It seems important to search for endocrine autoimmunity in every case of KSS.},

Less common features are retinal changes, short stature, kyphoscoliosis, preterm birth, photophobia, reduction of visual acuity, seizures, and delayed speech. SLS is characterized by a genetic block in the oxidation of fatty alcohol to fatty acid because of deficient activity of fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), a component of the fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase enzyme complex. As in other rare multisystem diseases, the diagnosis of SLS is often delayed. The definitive test for SLS is considered the measurement of FALDH or fatty alcohol: NAD oxidoreductase in cultured skin fibroblasts. Nevertheless, if specific FALDH activity test or DNA FALDH gene mutation tests are not available (as in our country), a reliable diagnosis of SLS is also possible when it is based on the matching of peculiar clinical, histologic and ultrastructural, laboratoristic, and imaging features. The simultaneous presence of cutaneous histologic features including hyperkeratosis, orthokeratosis, thickening of granular layer, abnormal lamellar inclusions in the cytoplasm of granular and horny cells (demonstrated by light and electron microscopy) in a child with ichthyosis, and typical neurologic abnormalities is highly suggestive of SLS. We describe the case of a young Moroccan boy presenting with ichthyosis, mental retardation, spastic diplegia, and peculiar skin histologic findings.},

Soon after the administration of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, a man who had recently recovered from an uncharacterized but self-limiting hepatitic illness, experienced a severe deterioration (AST 1687 U/L, INR 1.4). Anti-nuclear antibodies were detectable, and liver biopsy was compatible with autoimmune hepatitis. The observation supports the role of HAV as a trigger of autoimmune hepatitis. Studies in helper T-cell activity and antibody expression against hepatic proteins in the context of hepatitis A infection are summarized, and the concept of molecular mimicry with regard to other forms of viral hepatitis and autoimmunity is briefly explored.},

The accumulated glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial organs, histologically visible as Gaucher cells, is thought to provide chronic antigenic stimulus to the immune system. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia develops, and monoclonal populations of lymphocytes and plasma cells may arise from this premalignant proliferative state. How Gaucher disease is related to nonlymphoid malignancies remains unclear.},

General physical examination findings were within normal limits. On palpation, there was evidence of a vague lump in the left hypochondrial region. At ultrasonography (US) (images not shown), a large mass with heterogeneous echotexture was seen in the left suprarenal region; cystic areas and calcification were present. Chest radiography (images not shown) revealed bronchiectatic changes, with consolidation in the left lower zone. Results of a blood examination, including assessment of renal function, liver function, and complete blood count, were within normal limits.

In skeletal muscle, it was present at lower levels in cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-normal (87.2% +/- 11%) compared with COX-deficient fibers (97.3% +/- 2.6%); it was found in skin fibroblasts and blood cells, but at lower levels of heteroplasmy (15% +/- 6% and 17% +/- 10%, respectively). A second, heteroplasmic transition (A-->G), at nt 5656, showed a different distribution than the tRNA(Gly) mutation, with very low levels in skeletal muscle (< 3%) but higher levels in blood (22.7% +/- 3%) and skin fibroblasts (21% +/- 2%). These transitions were followed both in vivo, by repeat biopsy and blood sampling, and in vitro, by establishing primary cultures of myoblasts and skin fibroblasts. Repeat muscle biopsy showed a dramatic increase in COX-deficient fibers, but not of the tRNAGly mutation. Indeed, no significant change in heteroplasmy was measured for either substitution in muscle or blood. In vitro analysis gave very different results. The T10010C was not found in cultured myoblasts, even at early passage. In uncloned fibroblasts, the T10010C was stable (approximately 10%) for several passages but then gradually was lost. In contrast, the A5656G rose progressively from 27% to 91%. In cloned fibroblasts, different combinations of both base-pair changes and wild type could be identified, confirming the presence of clonal, intracellular triplasmy.},

Here we describe a 4-year-old infant with hyperlactacidemia, mild liver dysfunction, hypotonia, growth and psychomotor retardation, dysmorphic features and mitochondrial complex III deficiency. Respiratory chain enzyme activities showed an isolated complex III defect in muscle and fibroblasts. Sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis revealed a novel homozygous BCS1L mutation, c.148A>G, which caused a p.T50A substitution at an evolutionarily conserved BCS1L region. The severity of the complex III enzyme defect correlated with decreased amounts of BCS1L and respiratory chain complex III in the affected tissues. Our findings support a pathogenic role for the novel BCS1L mutation in a patient with a singular clinical phenotype.},

Diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion and confirmation is often obtained by means of surgical pathology. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this tumour, with recurrence being rare. Homer's syndrome is a common post-operative neurological consequence, but does not appear to cause problems to the patient. The case is described of a 42-year-old male who presented an asymptomatic left neck mass. Diagnostic studies included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound which confirmed a circumscribed mass in the upper left portion of the neck next to the thyroid gland. The mass was excised through a transverse left cervical skin incision. Post-operatively the patient showed clinical findings of Horner's syndrome. The pathologic and radiological evaluations, treatment and postoperative complications of this neoplasm are discussed.},

Primary or familial haemophagocytic syndrome appears to have a genetic aetiology, whereas secondary haemophagocytic syndrome may be associated with malignancy, autoimmune disease, or infection. Epstein-Barr virus is the most common infectious aetiology implicated in haemophagocytic syndrome, but the syndrome has been associated with a variety of other viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. We describe a case of haemophagocytic syndrome associated with disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We review all cases of M tuberculosis-associated haemophagocytic syndrome reported in the English language literature and discuss important issues pertaining to the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease.},

Histochemical analysis of a muscle-biopsy sample showed virtually absent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) stain, and biochemical studies confirmed an isolated reduction of COX activity. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial-encoded COX-subunit genes identified a heteroplasmic G-->A transition at nucleotide position 6930 in the gene for subunit I (COX I). The mutation changes a glycine codon to a stop codon, resulting in a predicted loss of the last 170 amino acids (33%) of the polypeptide. The mutation was present in the patient's muscle, myoblasts, and blood and was not detected in normal or disease controls. It was not detected in mtDNA from leukocytes of the patient's mother, sister, and four maternal aunts. We studied the genetic, biochemical, and morphological characteristics of transmitochondrial cybrid cell lines, obtained by fusing of platelets from the patient with human cells lacking endogenous mtDNA (rho0 cells). There was a direct relationship between the proportion of mutant mtDNA and the biochemical defect. We also observed that the threshold for the phenotypic expression of this mutation was lower than that reported in mutations involving tRNA genes. We suggest that the G6930A mutation causes a disruption in the assembly of the respiratory-chain complex IV.},

Common manifestations in SS patients include hypertension, coronary artery disease, venous thrombosis, miscarriages, psychiatric disturbances, and arterial and venous thrombotic events. Most patients present in their early 30s with classic neurovascular and dermatologic signs. Currently, the main criteria for the diagnosis of SS include livedo racemosa, focal neurological deficits or evidence of stroke on magnetic resonance imaging, or characteristic vascular alterations seen on biopsy. We present the case of a 37-year-old woman with extensive livedo racemosa, chronic migraine headaches, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous biopsies demonstrated a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate without the subendothelial proliferative changes or fibrosis seen in some patients with SS. The patient's medical history suggested idiopathic livedo racemosa with possible full progression to SS. This case highlights the variability in the clinical presentation of SS and that the disease often can be diagnosed before neurovascular events. Earlier diagnosis can lead to prevention of chronic occlusive neurovascular manifestations and irreversible damage such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Familiarity with the highly variable early course of SS can aid in diagnosis and reduction of morbidity and mortality that is associated with this disease.},

Detection of the MTS should be followed by a diagnostic protocol to assess multi-organ involvement. The incidence of JSRD ranges between 1/80,000 and 1/100,000 live births, although these values may represent an underestimate. The neurological components of JSRD include hypotonia, ataxia, intellectual disability, abnormal eye movements, and neonatal breathing problems. These may be associated with multi-organ involvement, mainly retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, hepatic fibrosis, and polydactyly. With the exception of rare X-linked recessive cases, JSRD follow autosomal recessive inheritance and are genetically heterogeneous. Ten causative genes have been identified to date, all encoding for proteins of the primary cilium, making JSRD part of a group of diseases called "ciliopathies". Analysis of causative genes is available in few laboratories worldwide on a research basis. The differential diagnosis must consider, in particular, the other ciliopathies, distinct cerebellar and brainstem congenital defects, and disorders with cerebro-oculo-renal manifestations. Recurrence risk is 25% in most families, although X-linked inheritance should also be considered. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach, with particular attention paid to respiratory problems in neonates. After the first months of life, the prognosis varies among JSRD subgroups, depending on the extent and severity of organ involvement.},

    abstract = {A case of a 60-year-old man with recurrent rectal villous adenoma is described. Preoperative staging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed very discordant results. EUS showed a tumour present in the mucosa with no submucosal invasion, while MRI revealed invasion of the muscularis propria consistent with an invasive stage T2 carcinoma. Based on the MRI findings, the patient underwent a low anterior resection of the tumour. The surgical pathology specimen revealed a villous adenoma with lowgrade dysplasia but no carcinoma and no extension into the muscularis propria. The present case highlights the uncertainty that currently exists as to which imaging modality provides the greatest accuracy in the staging of rectal cancer and in guiding the type of surgical procedure performed. Two recent meta-analyses and a systematic review of the literature point to EUS as the imaging modality of choice for determining muscularis propria and perirectal tissue invasion, as well as nodal involvement.},

The favourable outcome in our patient, better than most of the AIH cases, may be related both to the moderate necroinflammatory activity and to the low level of fibrosis at the beginning of the disease, or to the role of EBV as a trigger of AIH. The hypothesis that EBV related AIH could have a more favourable prognosis than most of the AIH cases in general needs to be confirmed in a larger series of studies.},

At the age of 2 1/2 years, after a minor respiratory infection, he developed unstable, broad-based gait and tremor of the hands. These symptoms persisted for the next several years, when ataxia became more prominent. Difficulty in swallowing, dysarthria, trunk dystonia, and marked dyskinesia of the arms and hands gradually developed. Nystagmus, transient ptosis, and strabismus also appeared. Abnormal laboratory findings included elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid lactate and pyruvate, with an abnormal lactate/pyruvate ratio. Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated signs of cerebellar atrophy, bilateral and symmetric hypodensities in the lentiform nucleus and thalamus, and transient hyperintensities of cerebral peduncles in T2-weighted sequences suggestive of Leigh disease. Muscle biopsy revealed isolated fiber atrophy, necrotic fibers undergoing phagocytosis, and no ragged-red fibers. The measured catalytic activity of cytochrome c oxidase in skeletal muscle homogenates demonstrated a partial cytochrome c oxidase deficiency No abnormalities in the mitochondrial genome and in the SURF-1 gene were found.

Allelic losses on 11q13, on which MEN-1 gene has been localized, have been noted in parathyroid and pancreatic tumors of patients with MEN-1, suggesting that the MEN-1 gene could act as a recessive tumor suppressor gene. One fundic argyrophil carcinoid tumor from a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and MEN-1 was studied. Loss of heterozygosity in the tumor DNA at loci close to MEN-1 locus was looked for using Southern technique with six DNA probes. Segregation of alleles was examined in relatives. In the tumor DNA, we found the loss of one allele with PYGM, the closest probe to the MEN-1 locus. The allele lost in the tumor had been transmitted by the unaffected parent. This suggests that in patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and MEN-1, the promotion of fundic argyrophil carcinoid tumors results from the inactivation of the two copies of MEN-1 gene and that fundic argyrophil carcinoid tumors may be included in the spectrum of MEN-1-related tumors.},

It has some similarities with multi-organ transplantation but offers certain advantages. This report highlights the experience of our interdisciplinary group regarding the treatment and follow-up of patients who received en-bloc transplantation, with the aim of encouraging the development of this surgical technique. CASE REPORT The first case is a 38-year-old patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and chronic kidney failure who received an en-bloc transplant of the liver, pancreas, and kidney with no intraoperative complications. He had a prolonged hospital stay due to anemia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which were resolved successfully. At follow-up, he had no requirement for insulin or for dialysis, or for new interventions. The second case describes a 48-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and liver cirrhosis who received an en-bloc transplant of the liver, pancreas, and kidney with no complications. During the postoperative period, the patient suffered a possible episode of acute tubular necrosis, which evolved towards improvement, with a tendency to normal metabolic and renal functioning, with no additional events. The patient is currently in follow-up and is insulin-independent. CONCLUSIONS En-bloc transplantation is a safe procedure, which is technically simple and which achieves excellent results. This procedure is indicated in patients with end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus that is difficult to control.},

A 60-year-old man presented with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest discomfort of 18-month history. Physical examination revealed S4, bilateral pretibial edema, and moderate amount of ascites. Computed tomography and X-ray of the thorax showed left-sided pleural effusion. Abdominal imaging showed normal liver and spleen structure with intraperitoneal effusion and periportal edema. Thoracentesis and paracentesis yielded a milky, lipemic fluid of exudative nature. Biochemical analysis of the fluids showed a high triglyceride content and elevated lymphocyte count, typical of chylous fluid. All laboratory analyses for possible etiologies including neoplasms, tuberculosis, and cirrhosis were negative. Positron-emission tomography did not show any pathological uptake. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed bilateral atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy, anteroseptal hypokinesia and akinesia, and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, with an ejection fraction of 25%. Coronary arteries were normal on angiography. The patient was diagnosed with severe congestive heart failure accompanied by chylothorax and chylous ascites. Despite appropriate treatment, there was little change in congestion and no change in symptoms. He died during ultrafiltration therapy due to hemodynamic collapse and asystole.},

The following case report illustrate this infrequent but critical situation. A 52-year-old woman with a history of hypertension awakened with acute retrosternal chest pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She was referred to our hospital for primary coronary intervention because of acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography indeed revealed LMCA occlusion. Subsequently successful percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation was performed, followed by immediate clinical improvement of the patient. Soon after admission at the coronary care unit, severe chest pain, hypotension, and electrocardiographic signs of diffuse myocardial ischemia relapsed. Control coronary angiography,however, showed no in-stent thrombosis. Review of clinical examination revealed an aortic regurgitation murmur. Because of this dynamic pattern of (1) signs of acute myocardial ischemia, (2) relapse of hemodynamic collapse, and (3) unaltered control coronary angiography together with the confirmed aortic regurgitation at transthoracic echocardiography, the patient was suspected of having aortic dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed Stanford type A aortic dissection with severe eccentric aortic regurgitation and no pericardial effusion. Emergent valve-sparing aortic replacement was performed. The patient recovered completely. In this case, the lifesaving element was primary coronary intervention with stenting of the LMCA preventing extensive myocardial damage followed by a surgical correction of the aorta.},

Angiography excluded coronary artery disease or coronary spasm. Short-term inotropic support was necessary. Rapid recovery of left ventricular function was observed after 8 days. Acute myocardial dysfunction due to TTC in the setting of SAH may lead to cardiogenic shock which is difficult to treat.

This occurrence, which is not yet well documented in humans, may have taken place in a patient on chronic oral hormonal contraceptive (OC) treatment who was seen for primary hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia and a pituitary mass. After thyroid hormone replacement, OC withdrawn and bromocriptine treatment, this patient could not maintain normal Prl levels, unless continuously treated with a dopaminergic agonist even when MRI was indicative of a normal situation. Function of TIDA neurons was investigated by TRH test (200 microg IV) performed before and after treatment with 25 mg carbidopa plus 250 mg L-dopa every 4 hours for one day. Basal TSH was normal (3.9 microU/mL) whereas basal Prl was high (67.5 ng/mL); both TSH and Prl levels appropriately increased after TRH: peaks 31.8 microU/mL and 157.8 ng/mL, respectively. After treatment with carbidopa/L-dopa, basal TSH (1.6 microU/mL) and Prl (34 ng/mL) decreased and the response to TRH was partially blocked (10.3 microU/mL and 61 ng/mL, respectively). In spite of a normal response, we discuss the possibility that the persistence of hyperprolactinemia is due to lesion of the TIDA neurons produced by the long term use of high doses of estrogens and by the presence of chronic hyperprolactinemia.},

Renal angiomyolipoma is a rare benign tumor that can occur sporadically, or in association with tuberous sclerosis. A case of spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage in a patient with tuberous sclerosis and bilateral renal angiomyolipoma is presented. CASE REPORT A 33-year-old female Caucasian patient, with a known medical history of tuberous sclerosis, was admitted to hospital as an emergency, with right-sided abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging showed bilateral renal tumors, consistent with bilateral renal angiomyolipoma. The larger tumor, involving the enlarged right kidney (24.0 cm in length), had a diameter of 21.0 cm and was associated with hemoperitoneum and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and contrast 'blush' on CT confirmed arterial bleeding. An initial urgent exploratory laparotomy with renal packing was initially performed, but right nephrectomy was required for hemorrhage control. The patient was discharged from hospital on the 23rd postoperative day, without further complications. CONCLUSIONS This report describes a case of Wunderlich's Syndrome, or spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage, in a patient with tuberous sclerosis and bilateral renal angiomyolipoma, presenting as an emergency. An early diagnosis and timely treatment are important in cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage to prevent life-threatening complications.},

The chronic neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease is characterized by a later onset of neurological symptoms and protracted neurological and visceral involvement. The first-choice treatment for nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant analogues of the deficient human enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to improve hematological and bone manifestations associated with Gaucher disease, but, as with most proteins, recombinant enzymes cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, which prevents effects on neurological manifestations. Substrate reduction therapy with miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin) inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. Because miglustat can cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been suggested that, combined with enzyme replacement therapy, it might be effective in treating neurological symptoms in patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease.},

The tumor is mostly functioning, causing severe primary hyperparathyroidism, with high serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Nonfunctioning PC is extremely rare. We report a 50-year-old male patient who was referred to our Department for a right thyroid nodule, incidentally detected on carotid Doppler ultrasound scan, with a fine-needle aspiration cytology showing a follicular lesion. At the time of our evaluation, neck ultrasound showed a 1.3 cm right hypoechoic thyroid nodule with irregular margins and the absence of enlarged bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Thyroid function tests were normal. Serum calcium was normal and plasma PTH slightly above the upper limit of the normal range. The patients underwent right lobectomy. The intraoperative frozen-section pathological examination raised the suspicion of a PC. Definitive histology showed a markedly irregular infiltrative growth of the tumor with invasion of the thyroid tissue and cervical soft tissues. Immunostaining for thyroglobulin was negative, whereas staining for chromogranin A and PTH showed a strong reactivity. Based on the microscopic findings and the immunohistochemical profile, the tumor was diagnosed as a PC. Postoperative serum calcium and phosphate levels were in the normal range. One month after surgery, serum calcium and PTH were normal. Neck ultrasound and total body computed tomography scan were negative for local and metastatic disease. Eight months later, serum calcium was normal and plasma PTH level remained around the upper limit of normal range. Neck ultrasound did not show any pathological lesions. This is the first case of a nonfunctioning sporadic PC misdiagnosed prior of surgery as a follicular thyroid nodule. The parathyroid nature of the neck lesion could not be suspected before surgery. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) may fail to distinguish a parathyroid tumor from a benign thyroid nodule because at FNAC, parathyroid and thyroid lesions have some morphological similarities. Histological criteria are not always sufficient for the differential diagnosis, which can definitely be established using immunohistochemistry.},

High dose steroids were started, then gradually tapered with good response. Horseshoe kidney is the most common renal fusion anomaly, with a prevalence of 0.25% among the general population. The occurrence of glomerular nephropathy in horseshoe kidney has been reported in few cases. We report the first case of minimal change disease occurring in a patient with horseshoe kidney in literature. The mechanism of the association between the horseshoe kidney and these renal pathologies could not be explained in the previous reports. There is no literature data indicating a high rate of glomerulonephritis in horseshoe kidneys. The co-incidence of two renal diseases in this patient can be only a coincidence. The question that arises is whether this glomerulopathy is associated or not with this anatomical abnormality. Further studies are needed to answer this question.},

Unlike warfarin, dabigatran's observed therapeutic window and minimal drug-to-drug interaction suggest that invasive laboratory testing and dose adjustment is not necessary. In circumstances of excessive anticoagulation, such as overdoses, decreased kidney function, or instances of significant bleeding, reversing dabigatran's effects may be necessary. Unlike warfarin, no rapid-acting antidote to reverse the effects of dabigatran is known. However, hemodialysis has been suggested as a method of removing dabigatran and thereby reducing its anticoagulant effect. We describe a case in which hemodialysis was used in an attempt to remove dabigatran in a patient with excessive anticoagulation from dabigatran and severe intracranial hemorrhage. Serial dabigatran levels suggested that hemodialysis removed the drug. However, given the large volume of distribution of dabigatran in the terminal phase of elimination, a rebound in drug level was noted. We suggest that a longer duration of therapy or more continuous modality of hemodialysis may be needed in conjunction with the initial hemodialysis treatment of dabigatran coagulopathy.},

Specific chromosomal abnormalities, however, have not been observed in such cases. Herein, we report a typical case of adrenal ML found incidentally in a 26-year-old man. Conventional cytogenetic techniques demonstrated balanced translocation between bands 3q25 and 21p11 in 9 of 20 metaphases analyzed in cultured tumor cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of adrenal ML showing chromosomal abnormality. This finding would indicate that adrenal ML is a bona fide neoplasm and the possibility of derivation from misplaced hematopoietic cells may be alternatively taken into consideration in view of the similar genetic changes in hematopolietic neoplasms.},

The most serious complications are coronary artery aneurysms and sequelae of vasculitis with the subsequent development of coronary artery aneurysm. According to the literature, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) plus high-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) were standard treatment for KD, whereas low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/day) was used for thrombocytosis in KD via antiplatelet effect. However, aspirin has been reported to have hemolytic potential in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. We report a child with G6PD-deficiency who has KD, and review the literature.},

Here, we present a case of SRC who developed a rare neurotoxic complication, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).A 36-year-old man with a history of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis developed SRC and acute-on-chronic renal failure and ultimately required maintenance hemodialysis. Three weeks after starting hemodialysis, the patient presented with confusion and a new-onset seizure disorder. Laboratory examinations revealed thrombocytopenia, a low haptoglobin level, and schizocytes on a blood smear. SRC-related PRES was considered first after PRES was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging. Antihypertensive therapy comprising captopril and amlodipine was administered, and the patient experienced a complete neurological recovery 3 days later without plasma exchange. In all previously reported cases of SRC-associated PRES, PRES developed before hemodialysis. Our report is, therefore, the first to describe a case of onset of SRC-related PRES 3 weeks after the initiation of maintenance hemodialysis.},

He underwent orthotopic transplantation with a heart from a blood-type-A male donor on 18 January 2001. After transplantation, the patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. Due to calcification of the left main and right coronary arteries, we performed triple coronary artery bypass (left anterior descending, circumflex, and right coronary arteries) with the recipient's saphenous vein. Despite high doses of inotropic agents and intra-aortic balloon pumping, the patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass; he was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 2 hours later. Meanwhile, there was another donor (a woman with type-O blood), who weighed 48 kg. Upon harvesting that heart for a recipient who weighed 68 kg, we found a laceration of the right ventricle. Therefore, we decided to use this marginal donor heart to rescue the graft-failure transplant by means of heterotopic heart transplantation. We left the 1st donor heart in situ. The postoperative series of endomyocardial biopsies showed variations between the 2 donor hearts in degrees of mild-to-moderate rejection. During the 6-year, 2-month follow-up period, the patient has fared well with 2 donor hearts, which beat independently but in conjunction. We conclude that heterotopic transplantation of a marginal donor heart can save an otherwise-dying orthotopic transplant recipient.},

The presented case shows a large mandibular reconstruction after tumor removal in a 31-year-old white man affected by ameloblastoma. In this case, the rhBMP-2 application with a carrier consisted on absorbable collagen sponge gives excellent newly formed bone at 18 months of control clinical and radiologic follow-up. The results indicated that the use of rhBMP-2 without concomitant autogenous bone grafting materials in large critical-sized mandibular defects secondary to large mandibular tumor produced excellent regeneration of the treated area.},

We report a 64-year-old woman with persistent symptoms of heart failure despite standard medical therapy. Echocardiography revealed reduced left ventricular filling due to a large apical mass; an abnormal diastolic filling pattern was also noticed. Complete blood count revealed remarkable hypereosinophilia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an apical thrombus and intense linear enhancement of the endocardium, which were compatible with Löffler endocarditis. Medical therapy, including corticosteroids and anticoagulation, was initiated promptly. The symptoms improved as the peripheral hypereosinophilia resolved in 15 days. The patient was asymptomatic at the 1-year follow-up visit with complete regression of the apical thrombus and no evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy. We report this case to draw attention to this particularly rare condition with poor prognosis since quick and accurate diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy may improve symptoms and survival.},

In this case the prematurity of opening in each beat was related to diastolic filling time and was accompanied by septal recoil and by premature closure of the mitral valve. We classified this as the diastolic duration-dependent subgroup. In the second patient, who had a hypertrophied, non-dilated left ventricle, premature opening depended on atrial contraction and was independent of diastolic filling time. This case defined an atrial contraction-dependent subgroup. In the light of these findings we analyzed previously reported cases in patients with acute severe aortic insufficiency.

When left untreated, more pronounced hypertrophy, signs of diastolic dysfunction and insufficient systolic function on exertion arise, and can lead to systolic dysfunction at rest, and eventually heart failure with signs of dilative cardiomyopathy. Increasingly, evidence suggests that early diagnosis and treatment of acromegaly (before the age of 40 years) can help prevent the progression of cardiovascular disease, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of premature mortality. This review focuses on management strategies for newly diagnosed patients with acromegaly and evidence of cardiovascular disease.

The patient was a 44-year-old man who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for a 27-mm cerebellopontine angle tumor that was discovered on investigation of tinnitus and hearing loss. He developed facial weakness after 5 years, and repeated imaging revealed tumor enlargement. Despite complete microsurgical excision, the tumor rapidly recurred locally and subsequently disseminated within the neuraxis. The patient died 1 year after tumor progression was detected. Histopathological analysis revealed a malignant spindle cell neoplasm with frequent mitotic figures. The presence of positive rhabdoid elements on immunohistochemical studies confirmed that it was a triton tumor. The authors review the relevant literature concerning the classification and management of malignant vestibular nerve tumors and discuss the implications of tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery.},

Neoplasm was radically removed by an endocrine surgeon through a right extended cervicotomy. A preoperative reliable diagnosis of chordoma, as in the reported case, is often difficult. Radical surgery can provide a favorable outcome but, given the high rates of local recurrence of this neoplasm, a strict and careful follow-up is recommended. Although very rare, chordoma should be suggested in the differential diagnosis of the paravertebral cervical masses of unknown origin. Spine surgeon consultation and a FNB should be routinely included in the multidisciplinary preoperative work-up of these neoplasms.},

He was subjected to a fasting test, a long-chain triglyceride (LCT) loading test (1.5 g/kg) and an intravenous carnitine clearance test (0.25 mumol/kg per min). Plasma acylcarnitines were analysed using a quantitative GC-CI-MS method. During fasting, all long-chain acylcarnitines with a chain length of C14 and higher (especially C14:1) increased dramatically. Total plasma long-chain acylcarnitine reached a concentration of 28.6 mumol/L. LCT loading resulted in a moderate increase, mainly of the C18 esters. The carnitine infusion, which led to a supranormal plasma free carnitine concentration, gave only a slight but generalized rise of long-chain acylcarnitines. Although only one patient could be tested, the results suggest that the accumulation of potentially toxic long-chain acylcarnitines in VLCAD deficiency is provoked by fasting, LCT loading and carnitine supplementation. Therapy should be adjusted accordingly.},

Gitelman syndrome is an inherited tubulopathy that must be considered in some settings of hypokalaemia. We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient referred to our nephrology department for persistent hypokalaemia. Clinical history was positive for symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and polyuria. There was no history of drugs consumption other than potassium supplements. Complementary evaluation revealed hypokalaemia (2.15 mmol/l), hypomagnesaemia (0.29 mmol/l), metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.535, bicarbonate 34.1 mmol/l), hypereninaemia (281.7 U/ml), increased chloride (160 mmol/l) and sodium (126 mmol/l) urinary excretion and reduced urinary calcium excretion (0.73 mmol/l). Renal function, remainder serum and urinary ionogram, and renal ultrasound were normal. A diagnosis of Gitelman syndrome was established. We reinforced oral supplementation with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate. Serum potassium stabilised around 3 mmol/l. The aim of our article is to remind Gitelman syndrome in the differential diagnosis of persistent hypokalaemia.},

Histochemical and electron microscopy examinations of skeletal muscle biopsy revealed abnormal mitochondria associated with a combined deficiency of complexes I and IV. After excluding mitochondrial DNA deletions and depletion, direct sequencing was used to screen for mutation in all transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. A T-to-C substitution at position 5693 in the tRNA(Asn) gene was found in blood and muscle. Microdissection of muscle biopsy and its analysis revealed the highest level of this mutation in cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative fibres. We suggest that this novel mutation would affect the anticodon loop structure of the tRNA(Asn) and cause a fatal mitochondrial disease.},

A 48 year old man with a long history of back pain presented with a two week history of increasing pain following a third session of acupuncture. Examination revealed tenderness in the right lumbosacral area and laboratory investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers with negative blood cultures. A bone scan and MRI scan showed evidence of septic arthritis of the right L5/S1 facet joint. An x ray computed tomography guided biopsy was carried out which isolated staphylococcus aureus. The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics. A repeat MRI scan demonstrated persistent septic arthritis with adjacent early abscess formation. Surgical debridement of the facet joint was therefore performed. The patient had resolution of his symptoms and the inflammatory markers returned to normal. He regained a full range of movement of the lumbar spine. Very few cases have been reported of lumbar facet joint septic arthritis and this condition is rare in association with acupuncture treatment. A high index of suspicion needs to be maintained and if conservative management fails then debridement can result in an acceptable outcome.},

Despite recent advances in radiological investigations, making a definitive diagnosis preoperatively remains challenging. This 45-year-old Indian gentleman presented with severe throbbing headache for six months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a sellar mass with peripheral enhancement that was misdiagnosed as a pituitary macroadenoma. A trans-sphenoidal excision was done, which surprisingly yielded only pus that was drained accordingly from the lesion. Fungal and bacterial cultures were negative. However this patient subsequently lost complete function of the pituitary gland, resulting in central diabetes insipidus and required permanent hormonal replacement therapy in the deficient endocrine axes. A Medline search was conducted and a review of 24 cases reported in the last 5 years discussed.},

We describe a case of a 42-year-old woman with fallopian tube cancer in which the founder mutation BRCA1c.2845insA was detected by mutational analysis. This same mutation was subsequently detected in four unaffected members of her family following genetic counseling. We report an association between this founder mutation and fallopian tube cancer as part of the hereditary breast cancer syndrome in an Asian population.

Nine months after initial diagnosis, radiographic studies revealed multiple pulmonary metastases. A dermatologic examination showed a solitary 1.2-cm chest nodule. Skin biopsy from this nodule revealed infiltrative dermal spindle cells arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the tumor cells to be PAX-8 (+), pancytokeratin (+, focally), TTF-1 (-) and SOX-10 (-). Comparison with the patient's primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma revealed focal areas of poorly differentiated spindle cells morphologically similar to the malignant spindle cells in the skin biopsy. Together, these findings confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma metastatic to skin. Cutaneous metastasis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma composed exclusively of spindle cells broadens the histologic differential diagnosis of cutaneous spindle cell malignancies and presents further diagnostic challenges. PAX-8 may be useful in discerning the spindle cell component of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma from other spindle cell malignancies in the skin.},

We report five consecutive cases of post-CABG constrictive pericarditis seen within a period of 17 months at our institution. All patients presented with heart failure of unknown etiology within a period of 8-84 months after surgery. During the initial post-CABG period, two patients had developed postcardiotomy syndrome that was successfully treated with steroids. They were all assessed noninvasively and invasively. In all patients, the diagnosis of constriction was initially suspected clinically (symptoms, high jugular venous pressure with deep "X" and "Y" descents, pericardial knock). Echocardiography showed transmitral flow typical of constriction in all patients and hepatic venous flow in two. Two patients showed rapid left ventricular relaxation. In all patients, hemodynamic assessment showed diastolic equalization of pressures in all chambers, "W" shape waveform in right atrial pressure, and "dip and plateau" configuration in right and left ventricular pressure waveforms. Diagnosis was confirmed surgically in four patients who were subjected to pericardiectomy-pericardial stripping (three survived, one died). One patient refused surgery. We conclude that constrictive pericarditis, although rare, should be suspected in every case of unexplained dyspnea post CABG. It can appear early or late after surgery, and clinical examination plays an important role in its early recognition. It requires a full noninvasive and invasive assessment in case of clinical suspicion.},

We report successful bilateral lung transplantation in a 49-year-old woman with GD complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension and fibrotic changes in the lungs. Before receiving the lung transplant, the patient was undergoing both enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase) and triple pulmonary hypertension treatment (epoprostenol, bosentan, and sildenafil). She had a history of splenectomy, severe bone disease, and renal involvement, all of which were related to GD and considered as relative contraindications for a lung transplantation. In the literature, lung transplantation has been suggested for severe pulmonary involvement in GD but has been reported only once in a child. To our knowledge, until now, no successful procedure has been reported in adults, and no reports deal with the severe potential posttransplantation complications specifically related to GD.},

The technique consists of asymmetric physeal distraction of the proximal tibial growth plate by using a modified Wagner fixator-distractor device that allows progressive angular correction. The patient had a 23 degrees varus deviation of the left tibia, and no physeal bone bridges were detected. Once the fixator was assembled, distraction started 24 h after surgery at a rate of 1.5 mm/day (2 x 0.75). Complete correction was achieved in 25 days. No osteotomy of the fibula was required. The Wagner device was removed in the outpatient clinic 10 weeks postoperatively. After a 4-year follow-up, there was no loss of correction, showing a satisfactory alignment of the operated-on lower extremity. As compared with acute conventional osteotomies, asymmetric physeal distraction entails several advantages for treatment of Blount disease such as less invasive surgery, progressive and adjustable correction taking place at the apex of the deformity, and the possibility of bone lengthening if needed. Furthermore, physeal distraction does not require a second surgical step for bonegraft harvesting or for removal of the internal fixation.},

While Berlin Heart EXCOR is widely accepted as ventricular assistance in pediatric patients with end-stage cardiac failure, infections remain a frequent and potentially severe complication. Therefore, the extended use of the device in the setting of intermittent or severe neutropenia is challenging. We present the case of a three-yr child with Barth syndrome who was bridged successfully to transplant with a Berlin Heart EXCOR assist device for eight months (251 days) without major infectious complication, despite several episodes of severe neutropenia. This case demonstrates that prolonged mechanical circulatory support for a patient with neutropenia is feasible without important morbidity, with careful monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach.

Recently lumbar spondylodiscitis was diagnosed. The Wright (1/320) and Coombs Wright tests (1/640) were positive. After CNS imaging, lumbar puncture was done. The CSF pleocytosis was lymphocyte dominant. In cardiac echocardiography, large vegetation on prosthetic aortic valve leaflets was seen. The brain MRI was reported abnormal. Treatment of brucellosis started with Ceftriaxone, Doxycycline, Rifampin and Gentamycin. After 4 days, he became oriented, and fever was disappeared then we continued the treatment for 16 days. The patient discharged and followed by daily phone calls. As symptoms of abdominal pain and jaundice were presented on the fifth day, he re-admitted. The patient expired because of hepatorenal and cardiac insufficiency. Drug side effects, activation of Hepatitis B and embolism of cardiac vegetation to other organs were suspected causes of death. We do not suggest medical therapy without cardiac surgery in such cases. When combination therapy is necessary for brucellosis in an HBsAg-positive patient, hepatitis virus activity should be assess by HBV-DNA PCR and the dose of drugs with known hepatotoxic effects such as rifampin and co-trimoxazole should be adjust. Combination therapy with quinolones instead of hepatoxic drugs is one of our suggustions.},

It preferentially affects women and causes progressive thoracic myelopathy that presents as a Brown-Séquard syndrome or as spastic paraparesis. Although its etiology and pathogenesis are controversial, ISCH is characterized by the presence of an anterior dural defect that allows the incarceration of a segment of the cord. Typically, a C-shaped ventral displacement and kinking of the cord are visible on sagittal MRI. Surgery aimed at stopping or reversing myelopathic symptoms is usually recommended for symptomatic patients. Surgical options include reduction of the hernia and direct suturing, or enlargement of the dural defect, with or without patching. Suturing under the cord in a very tight space can be troublesome and may lead to neurological deterioration. The authors present the case of a symptomatic ISCH in which nonpenetrating titanium microstaples were used to close the dural defect after cord reduction. The patient experienced a good outcome, and the follow-up MRI study showed adequate cord repositioning and stability of the suture. The use of microstaples, which allows for an easier and faster dural closure than conventional suturing, is a novel technical adjunct that has not been previously reported for this condition. In addition, microstaples produce minimal metallic artifact that does not hinder the quality of follow-up MR images.},

    abstract = {A case of mitral stenosis following mitral valve replacement in a patient with endocardial fibroelastosis is reported. A 14-year-old boy presented with cardiac failure. He had been diagnosed as having endocardial fibroelastosis at the age of 7 months and had undergone resection of endocardial fibrous tissue in the left ventricle at that time. Five years later his mitral valve was resected owing to mitral stenosis, with Bjork-Shiley valve replacement. Cross-sectional echocardiography on this admission showed restrictive left ventricular inflow due to a thickened immobile prosthetic valve with severely dyskinetic left ventricle (ejection fraction 8%). The electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. Despite direct current cardioversion and continual amiodarone infusion he suffered a cardiac arrest and died 12 days after admission. Postmortem examination showed left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis with severe inflow obstruction due to the formation of a complete fibrous ring of pannus/fibrosis around the prosthetic margin on the ventricular aspect of the left ventricle. This complication has not previously been described in children after mitral valve replacement.},

The most common manifestations of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are pulmonary symptoms. Primary abdominal lymphangioleiomyomatosis without any pathological changes in the respiratory system is extremely unusual. We report a case of primary abdominal lymphangioleiomyomatosis located between the left hepatic and gastric antrum of a 29-year-old woman. The patient had no typical symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (dyspnea, pneumothorax) or abdominal pain. All physical examination findings were normal. Laboratory test results, including routine blood examination, liver and kidney function, tumor markers, blood coagulation function, and urine and stool examinations, were all normal. She found abdominal cyst in an annual medical examination by ultrasonography and confirmed by computed tomography. For a clear diagnosis, a laparoscopic abdominal mass resection was performed. The postoperative pathohistological examination findings allowed for the definitive diagnosis.

In acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, KS has an aggressive course and carries poor prognosis. We present a case of pulmonary KS with osseous metastases as the first presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a young male. The lesions impressively decreased in size and numbers following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). CASE REPORT A 34-year-old heterosexual male presented with a one month history of cough and 15-20 pound weight loss within six months. Examination revealed oral thrush, decreased breath sounds and crackles on the right lower lung base. Imaging showed a large right perihilar mass with multiple lytic lesions involving thoracic and lumber vertebrae, ribs, sternum, and clavicles. Blood and sputum cultures, smears for acid fast bacilli, and a QUANTIferon gold test were all negative. He tested positive for HIV and his CD4 count was 7 cells/uL. Bronchoscopy with biopsy was unrevealing. Pathology of the right hilar mass was diagnostic of KS. Following initiation of antiretroviral therapy his condition dramatically improved; repeat chest CT scan showed marked regression of the bony and pulmonary lesions. CONCLUSIONS The dual action of HAART on the recovery of the immune system and against human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) may essentially cause regression of KS lesions.},

Three years after injury, she remained paraplegic and underwent olfactory mucosal cell implantation at the site of injury. She developed back pain 8 years later, and imaging revealed an intramedullary spinal cord mass at the site of cell implantation, which required resection. Intraoperative findings revealed an expanded spinal cord with a multicystic mass containing large amounts of thick mucus-like material. Histological examination and immunohistochemical staining revealed that the mass was composed mostly of cysts lined by respiratory epithelium, submucosal glands with goblet cells, and intervening nerve twigs. This is the first report of a human spinal cord mass complicating spinal cord cell transplantation and neural stem cell therapy. Given the prolonged time to presentation, safety monitoring of all patients with cell transplantation and neural stem cell implantation should be maintained for many years.},

The present report describes what appears to be a unique example of dermal hamartomatous polypoid CD34(+) fibrogenic proliferation devoid of melanin, namely a dendrocytoma, surrounded by the melanocytes from the nevus, located in the skin of the scrotum against a background of giant CMN. The differential diagnosis included dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, giant-cell fibroblastoma, angiofibroma, Bednar tumor, other types of dermal dendrocytic hamartoma, and neurocristic cutaneous hamartoma.

Liver-kidney-microsome type-1 (LKM-1) antibodies directed against the autoantigen cytochrome CYP2D6 define a group of patients with autoimmune hepatitis type-2 (AIH-2), distinct from autoimmune hepatitis type-1 (AIH-1) in which anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) with actin specificity are present in patient sera. Autoantibodies were studied by the quantitative CYP2D6 radioligand assay (RLA) that uses a radiolabeled CYP2D6 as antigen, immunoblotting using recombinant CYP2D6 protein and human liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions, and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using rat kidney-stomach-liver cryostat sections. In addition, the specificity of anti-SMA was detected by IIF on HEp2 cell line harvested with colchicin. This report describes the time course of CYP2D6 antibodies and the appearance of anti-SMA (without anti-actin, cytokeratin and vimentin reactivity) associated with acute rejection during a 2-year follow-up, in a patient who underwent transplantation at end-stage type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. In addition, we report a new reactivity against an unknown 40-kDa protein using a rat cytosolic fraction. The detection of autoantibodies in sequential samples may be important to better predict rejection or relapse, and to establish adequate therapy.},

The mutant mtDNA was heteroplasmic (80% mutant) in patient muscle but was undetectable in blood from the patient and his healthy mother and sisters. A maternally inherited cytochrome b polymorphism was also identified in this patient. Molecular screening of 150 individuals showed that the G290D mutation associated with the described phenotype.

We present the case of a 64-year-old woman presenting with rapid onset, painful distal symmetrical lower limb weakness and an acute kidney injury. Owing to her IgG κ paraprotein (kappa light chain 4620, kappa:lambda ratio 826), she was diagnosed with probable plasma cell myeloma. This diagnosis was confirmed following a trephine biopsy. She required renal replacement therapy, inotropic support and a percutaneous tracheostomy. She became acutely confused with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10/15 and a CT head showed no acute pathology. Further investigation with a lumbar puncture confirmed the diagnosis of streptococcal meningitis. She was treated with intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone and fluconazole. Her non-bronchoalveolar lavage revealed a diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and she required treatment with co-trimoxazole. This case report discusses the clinical presentation, diagnostic algorithm and treatment of myeloma. This manuscript offers an important clinical reminder to consider myeloma in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with bone pain and acute kidney injury.},

    abstract = {In the last few years, inborn errors of oxidative phosphorylation have been recognized as possible causes of hepatic failure in infancy and respiratory enzyme deficiencies have been described in several tissues of affected individuals. Here, we report on cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in the liver but not in the skeletal muscle of a 5-month-old girl who presented hepatic failure in early infancy. Persistent hyperlactatemia (> 4 mM, normal < 2.4) with high lactate/pyruvate (L/P) molar ratios in plasma, and their further elevation in the post-absorptive period were suggestive of an inborn error of oxidative phosphorylation. However, no mutation in the coding sequences of the liver-specific subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (VIa and VIIa) has been detected and no major rearrangement or depletion of the mitochondrial DNA has been observed. Based on this observation we suggest that inborn errors of oxidative phosphorylation be considered in the diagnosis of severe hepatocellular dysfunction of unknown origin, especially when an abnormal oxidation-reduction status is found in the plasma and even if normal respiratory enzyme activities are found in peripheral tissues. The findings of normal respiratory enzyme activities in skeletal muscle, circulating lymphocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts does not rule out this diagnosis. Instead, the negativity of these tests should prompt one to carry out the specific enzyme assays in the tissue which expresses the disease, namely the liver.},

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT II) is a significant complication rarely reported in the setting of adult VAD support; no similar report exists concerning pediatric VAD support. We report on a 13-month-old, 8.1 kg girl who required LVAD support for cardiogenic shock of unclear etiology. The patient had a history of multiple surgical repairs for correction of complex congenital heart disease consisting of a series of left heart obstructive lesions (Shone's complex). Despite aggressive ventilatory and inotropic support, the patient continued to deteriorate and subsequently required extracorporeal life support. After 7 days of conventional venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a 10 ml Berlin Heart VAD was implanted. After implantation, the patient developed persistent low-grade fever of unclear etiology, gradual thrombocytopenia, and deterioration of renal function. On postimplant day 10, the pump required replacement because of concerns about an inlet valve thrombus; the explanted device demonstrated a nearly occlusive clot not appreciable from external inspection. Simultaneously, HIT II was diagnosed as a result of hematology workup for persistent thrombocytopenia. We discuss the unique challenges posed by HIT II complicating pediatric VAD support and in relation to the heparin coating of the device.},

The syndrome is caused by a defective thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys. Gitelman syndrome could be confused with Bartter syndrome; the main differentiating feature is the presence of low urinary calcium excretion in the former. Descriptions of neuroradiological imaging findings associated with Gitelman syndrome are very scarce in the literature and include basal ganglia calcification, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and sclerochoroidal calcification. Cauda equina syndrome-like presentation has been reported, but without any corresponding imaging findings on lumbar spine MRI. We report a 13-year-old male with Gitelman syndrome who presented with altered mental status following a fall and scalp laceration and unremarkable brain CT, followed during hospitalization by somnolence and seizures. Metabolically the patient demonstrated hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. MRI demonstrated features of encephalopathy including predominantly right-sided cerebral hemispheric signal abnormality and cytotoxic edema, with bilateral symmetric involvement of the thalami, midbrain tegmentum and tectum and cerebellar dentate nuclei. MRI after five months obtained during a later episode of encephalopathy showed resolution of the signal abnormalities with setting in of brain atrophy and also areas of newly developed cytotoxic edema in the left thalamus, bilateral dorsal midbrain and right greater than left dentate nuclei. The described abnormalities, either recurrent or in isolation, have not previously been published in patients with Gitelman syndrome. We believe that the findings are due to alteration of respiratory chain function secondary to the metabolic derangement and hence have a similar imaging appearance as encephalopathy related to mitochondrial cytopathy or metabolic encephalopathy.},

A systemic-to-pulmonary vein fistula (SAPVF) was suspected. The selective angiography showed numerous fistulae between intercostals, thyro-cervical, internal mammary arteries and pulmonary veins. The thoracic CT performed before the CMR, which was initially considered as normal, showed well these arteriovenous fistulae after 3D MIP reconstruction. This particular observation highlights the great value of multimodality imaging for the diagnosis of this rare pathology. The MR velocity mapping is a noninvasive imaging technique of great interest to guide the diagnosis of arteriovenous fistulae, and further indicating more invasive complementary imaging modalities like selective arterial angiography.},

We report the case of a 76-year-old woman who presented an ulcerative interscapular lesion measuring 3x4cm. After resection, the histological examinations of the specimens have identified a basal cell carcinoma. However, a local recurrence was observed 18 months later; histopathological findings showed a syringomatous pattern and neoplastic epithelial cells arranged in interconnecting cords with microcystic areas. Nests, cords, and tubules of the tumour extended into the dermis and into the adjacent muscle. Sclerosis of stroma around the cords was present. Tumour cells were not connected to the epidermis. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for anti-CK7, AE1/AE3 and negativity for anti CEA and anti CK20. These histological and immunohistochemical analyses were consistent with the diagnosis of syringomatous eccrine carcinoma. Syringomatous carcinoma is an extremely invasive tumor, locally destructive and slowly growing adnexal tumour, derived from eccrine sweat glands. It is often mistaken, both clinically and microscopically, for other benign and malignant entities. The tumour recurrence is high due to extensive perineural invasion, but regional or distant metastases are rare. The local aggressive nature of the tumour and the high recurrence rate may necessitate mutilating procedures. Optimal treatment consists of a complete microscopically controlled surgical excision with clear surgical margins.},

The patient underwent radical subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and Billroth II gastrojejunostomy. Histopathological evaluation confirmed double primary gastric cancer: gastric choriocarcinoma admixed with an AFP-producing adenocarcinoma and separated adenocarcinoma. At 2 wk postoperatively, his human chorionic gonadotropin and AFP levels had reduced and six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were initiated. No recurrence or distant metastasis was observed at 4 years postoperatively.},

After a long, disease-free period, however, spinal drop metastases occurred 32 months after resection of the primary tumor. The primary and metastatic lesions had a similar histological appearance, meaning that multiple spinal metastatic lesions occurred through CSF route even after a gross total resection of the tumor. Tumor seeding during surgery is the evident reason for spinal metastasis, although we strictly adhered to the standard precautions for operations for malignant tumors such as obstruction of the cisterna magna with cotton paddies, and changing surgical gloves and instruments during the operation. In this report, we briefly discuss an exceedingly rare variant of meningioma, the papillary variant, and suggest a new approach, a CSF sampling, in the management of both malignant and benign meningiomas. CSF sampling allows for the early detection of metastasis and of tumor cells before metastasis has occurred, thus allowing treatment to begin as soon as possible. This early detection and management is possibly associated with longer survival. Furthermore, we discussed that meningiomas are tumors that are not as benign as initially thought.},

    abstract = {A 69-year-old woman presented with arterial hypotension, pulmonary oedema and a severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% only 3 days after having received her first treatment for colorectal cancer with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapy. The ECG demonstrated widespread ST-segment depression and echocardiography showed uniform hypokinesia of all left ventricular (LV) myocardial segments without signs of regional LV ballooning. Coronary angiography was normal and the patient gained full recovery after receiving treatment with heart failure medication. Interestingly, cardiac MRI scan 9 days later showed a normal LVEF with signs of neither myocardial oedema nor necrosis. Despite the high therapeutic efficacy of 5-FU in treatment of colorectal cancer, it is associated with undesired cardiac toxicities including coronary spasms, toxic inflammation and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. However, our patient did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for the aforementioned complications. Based on this case report, we discuss alternative mechanisms including myocardial adenosine triphosphate depletion suggested from animal experiments.},

TTS is also known as stress cardiomyopathy, broken heart syndrome, apical ballooning, reversible acute heart failure, neurogenic stunned myocardium or acute catecholamine cardiomyopathy. This case report describes an uncommon presentation of myocardial stunning after an anesthetic procedure. A 14-year-old girl with a history of pineal cyst and hemiplegic migraine was admitted for control brain magnetic resonance imaging. During anesthesia induction with propofol she suffered bradycardia, which was reversed with atropine, followed by tachyarrhythmia, reversed with lidocaine and precordial thump. Within hours she developed pulmonary edema and global respiratory failure due to acute left ventricular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle with global hypokinesia and depressed left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <30%). The electrocardiogram showed persistent sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated (troponin 2.42 ng/ml, proBNP 8248 pg/ml). She was placed on diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin and dopamine. The clinical course was satisfactory with clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic improvement within four days. Subsequent echocardiograms showed no ventricular dysfunction. The patient was discharged home on carvedilol, which was discontinued after normalization of cardiac function on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Few cases of TTS have been described in children, some of them triggered by acute central nervous system disorders and others not fulfilling all the classical diagnostic criteria. In this case the anesthetic procedure probably triggered the TTS.},

Liver histologic analysis is still considered the reference standard in the assessment of liver fibrosis despite the interobserver and interobserver variability in staging and some morbidity and mortality risks. Thus, noninvasive methods for assessing liver fibrosis are of great clinical interest. In the last decade, ultrasound-based techniques to estimate the stage of liver fibrosis have become commercially available. They all have the capability to noninvasively evaluate differences in the elastic properties of soft tissues by measuring tissue behavior when a mechanical stress is applied. Shear wave elastography relies on the generation of shear waves determined by the displacement of tissues induced by the force of a focused ultrasound beam or by an external push. This article reviews the results that have been obtained with shear wave elastography for assessment of liver fibrosis.},

The panoramic radiography was complemented by the Donovan's radiographic technique; but because of the proximity of the dental element to the mandibular ramus, it was not possible to have a final fusion diagnosis. Hence, the Cone-Beam Computed Tomography-which provides precise three-dimensional information-was used to determinate the fusion diagnosis and also to help in the surgical planning. In this case report we observed that the periapical, occlusal and panoramic were not able to show details which could only be examined through the cone-beam computed tomography.},

The main manifestations are cardiomyopathy, myopathy, hypotonia, growth delay, intermittent neutropenia and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Diagnosis is confirmed by mutational analysis of the TAZ gene and biochemical dosage of the monolysocardiolipin/tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin (MLCL:L4-CL) ratio. We report a 6-year-old boy who presented with severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis and severe dilated cardiomyopathy soon after birth. The MLCL:L4-CL ratio confirmed BTHS (3.90 on patient's fibroblast, normal: 0-0.3). Subsequent sequencing of the TAZ gene revealed only the new synonymous variant NM_000116.3 (TAZ):c.348C>T p.(Gly116Gly), which did not appear to affect the protein sequence. In silico prediction analysis suggested the new c.348C>T nucleotide change could alter the TAZ mRNA splicing processing. We analyzed TAZ mRNAs in the patient's fibroblasts and found an abnormal skipping of 24 bases (NM_000116.3:c.346_371), with the consequent ablation of 8 amino acid residues in the tafazzin protein (NP_000107.1:p.Lys117_Gly124del). Molecular analysis of at risk female family members identified the patient's sister and mother as heterozygous carriers. Apparently harmless synonymous variants in the TAZ gene can damage gene expression. Such findings widen our knowledge of molecular heterogeneity in BTHS.},

Friedreich's ataxia typically causes motor abnormalities of the extremities, mainly impairing walking and the coordination of the legs and arms. The myocardium is affected at a later stage of the disease. The extent and timing of myocardial involvement determines the clinical course. Some patients have no cardiac symptoms and cardiac involvement can be established only by electrocardiographic or echocardiographic examination. In addition some pathological studies have found evidence of coronary abnormalities, mainly in the small vessels. There are no reports that such lesions cause angina. In a 16 year old patient chest pain on exercise had been the presenting symptom of Friedreich's ataxia at the age of 9. Considerable alterations in ventricular repolarisation on the electrocardiogram suggested a congenital coronary abnormality or hypertrophic myocardiopathy. The results of a Doppler echocardiography, Holter monitoring, and a haemodynamic study with coronary arteriography were all normal. An exercise test when the boy was 13 indicated significant changes in ventricular repolarisation. Myocardial scintigraphy (99mTc-MIBI) at that time, however, was normal. He improved slightly when he was treated with verapamil. When he was 15 neurological symptoms developed and Friedreich's ataxia was diagnosed. Typical angina during exercise seems to have been the first symptom of Friedreich's ataxia.},

A patient is described with textual visual hallucinations of a very different linguistic content following bilateral occipito-temporal infarcts. The hallucinations consisted of grammatically correct, meaningful written sentences or phrases, often in the second person and with a threatening and command-like nature (syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations). A detailed phenomenological interview and visual psychophysical testing were undertaken. The patient showed a classical ventral occipito-temporal syndrome with achromatopsia, prosopagnosia, and associative visual agnosia. Of particular significance was the presence of pure alexia. Illusions of colour induced by monochromatic gratings and a novel motion-direction illusion were also observed, both consistent with the residual capacities of the patient's spared visual cortex. The content of orthographic visual hallucinations matches the known specialisations of an area in the left posterior fusiform gyrus--the visual word form area (VWFA)--suggesting the two are related. The VWFA is unlikely to be responsible for the syntacto-semantic hallucinations described here as the patient had a pure alexic syndrome, a known consequence of VWFA lesions. Syntacto-semantic visual hallucinations may represent a separate category of textual hallucinations related to the cortical network implicated in the auditory hallucinations of schizophrenia.},

The patient had been treated during the year before her presentation with sunitinib, an antiangiogenic drug, for renal cell carcinoma. The clinical, radiographic, and histologic picture of a chronic nonhealing extraction socket was consistent with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), although she had never been treated with bisphosphonates or corticosteroids. The treatment with sunitinib was discontinued and the patient was treated with antibiotics and physiotherapy for 12 weeks with complete recovery. Sunitinib may cause osteonecrosis of the jaw after oral surgical interventions with no previous exposure to bisphosphonates. The pathogenesis may be related to its antiangiogenic mechanism and impaired wound healing. Full recovery may require long-term cessation of the insulting drug combined with prolonged antibiotic treatment.},

Diffusion-weighted imaging showed cytotoxic edema interpreted as acute-phase encephalopathy. MR spectroscopy revealed a lactate peak in the cortex that appeared abnormal on diffusion-weighted images, possibly representing respiratory deficiency with anaerobic metabolism. MR spectroscopy proved to be more sensitive regarding lactate detection than did neurometabolic examination of serum and CSF. A reduced N-acetylaspartate-creatine ratio was detected in both the cortex that appeared abnormal and the cortex that appeared normal on the diffusion-weighted images, indicating neuronal damage that was widespread, even beyond the boundaries of conventional MR imaging changes.},

Clinically, she presented with an ulceration of the skin, which had developed within a few months. On conventional histology, the tumor cells were mimicking poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with a prominent leukocytic infiltrate. The immunoprofile of the tumor showed negativity for cytokeratins and led to the diagnosis of a CD30-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma.},

Fresh frozen plasma infusions and plasma exchange represent the most efficient therapy of acute TTP. A specific protease responsible for cleavage of vWF multimers has been recently isolated from normal human plasma and was found to be deficient in four patients with chronic relapsing TTP. We examined the activity of the vWF-cleaving protease in plasma samples collected over a period of 400 days from a further patient with recurrent episodes of TTP who was treated by plasma exchange, plasma infusion, vincristine, corticosteroid therapy, and splenectomy. Complete deficiency of the vWF-cleaving protease was established during the first episode of TTP. The ensuing normalization of the platelet count was associated with the appearance of the protease activity. Three months after remission from the initial TTP event, the vWF-cleaving protease again disappeared and the platelet count gradually decreased. Relapses of severe thrombocytopenia occurred 7 and 11 months after the first acute episode of TTP. Deficient protease activity was associated with the presence in the patient plasma of an inhibitor that was found to be an IgG. Plasma exchange/infusion was followed by a temporary increase in the antibody titer, whereas treatment with vincristine led to a recovery of the platelet count without affecting the inhibitor concentration. Splenectomy and corticosteroid treatment resulted in disappearance of the autoantibody and normalization of the protease activity and of the platelet count. Our data suggest that the thrombocytopenia in this patient with TTP was associated with a lack of the vWF-cleaving protease activity depleted by an autoimmune mechanism. This case, together with our previously reported patients, leads us to conclude that acquired as well as constitutional deficiency of the vWF-cleaving protease may predispose to TTP.},

    abstract = {Asparaginase (ASP) is an effective chemotherapy agent extensively used in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). There has been a recent interest in using ASP in adults with ALL, particularly the less toxic pegylated (PEG) formulation. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a rare complication of PEG-ASP therapy. We report two cases of obese patients who developed severe HTG after receiving PEG for ALL. Both patients were incidentally found to have severe HTG (TG of 4,330 and 4,420 mg/dL). In both patients, there was no personal or family history of dyslipidemia or hypothyroidism. There was no evidence of pancreatitis or skin manifestations of HTG. Both patients were treated with PEG cessation, low-fat diet and pharmacotherapy. Both patients were re-challenged with PEG, with subsequent increase in TG but no associated complications. TG returned to baseline after discontinuing PEG and while on therapy for HTG. A literature review of PEG-induced HTG in adults demonstrated similar results: asymptomatic presentation despite very severe HTG. HTG is a rare but clinically important adverse effect of PEG. Underlying obesity and/or diabetes may represent risk factors. Clinicians should monitor TG levels during PEG therapy to avoid TG-induced pancreatitis.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome generated by the reciprocal translocation t(9: 22)(q34;q11). CML is usually diagnosed in the chronic phase. Blast crisis represents an advanced phase of CML. Extramedullary blast crisis as the initial presentation of CML with bone marrow remaining in chronic phase is an unusual event. Further, extramedullary blast crisis with T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal phenotype as an initial presentation for CML is extremely unusual. CASE REPORT Here, we report the case of a 49-year-old male with rapidly enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Biopsy specimen from the nodes revealed a characteristic appearance with morphologically and immunohistochemically distinct myeloblasts and T lymphoblasts co-localized in 2 adjacent regions, accompanied by chronic phase of the disease in bone marrow. The presence of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene within both cellular populations in this case confirmed the extramedullary disease represented a localized T lymphoid/myeloid bilineal blastic transformation of CML. After 3 courses of combined chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, the mass was completely regressed with a 3-log decrease in BCR/ABL1 transcript from baseline. Five months after the diagnosis, the patient showed diminished vision, hand tremors, and weakness of lower extremities. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of cerebrospinal fluid revealed the presence of myeloid blasts. An isolated central nervous system relapse of leukemia was identified. Following high-dose systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy, the patient continued to do well. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of extramedullary blast crisis as an initial presentation in patients with CML should be considered. Further, an isolated central nervous system blast crisis should be considered if neurological symptoms evolve in patients who have shown a good response to therapy.},

Large randomized clinical trials have shown higher doses of dabigatran (150 mg taken twice daily) to be superior to warfarin in terms of stroke and systemic embolism rates in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. As a result, in 2010 the US FDA approved the use of dabigatran for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran is especially attractive in the outpatient setting because patients do not require routine monitoring with prothrombin times or international normalized ratios. To date, no effective reversal agent for dabigatran in the event of catastrophic hemorrhage has been identified. The authors report a case of an elderly patient, being treated with dabigatran for atrial fibrillation, who presented with a rapidly expanding intracranial hemorrhage after a ground-level fall. This case highlights an impending neurosurgical quandary of complications secondary to this new anticoagulation agent and suggests potential options for management.},

Two years after the transplantation, a continuous murmur occurred at the left sternal edge after repeated endomyocardial biopsies. Echocardiography and coronary angiography revealed a dilated left anterior descending artery with a fistula to the right ventricle. The circumflex was large with an equally postero-lateral branch, and the right coronary artery was rather small with collaterals to the distal part of the left anterior descending branch. The patient had refused any intervention to close the fistula. The left ventricular levogram was normal. Two years later, in a follow-up angiogram, the left ventricular ejection fraction had decreased as a result of hypo- and akinesis of the apex and posterior wall. We suggest that this local wall motion disturbance derives from a steal phenomenon rather than being a sequela of rejection. The decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction was associated with shortness of breath upon moderate exercise. Standard heart failure medication relieved the patient's symptoms. The observation of local wall motion disturbances in this case, as well as conflicting views in the literature, raises the question whether postbiopsy coronary fistulas in transplant patients should be closed.},

Accordingly, in the particular case of a patient presenting with a partial complex I and IV deficiency, we observed a strongly reduced ability to oxidize NADH in the presence of succinate.

However, TS also includes cognitive impairment, autism and major developmental delays in many of the patients. We observed the appearance of bipolar disorder (BD) in a patient with a previously reported case of TS, who is one of the very few patients to survive childhood. This is most interesting because the common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) most highly associated with BD is rs1006737, which we show here is a cis-expression quantitative trait locus for CACNA1C in human cerebellum, and the risk allele (A) is associated with decreased expression. To combine the CACNA1C perturbations in the presence of BD in this patient and in patients with the common CACNA1C SNP risk allele, we would propose that either increase or decrease in calcium influx in excitable cells can be associated with BD. In treatment of BD with calcium channel blocking drugs, we would predict better response in patients without the risk allele, because they have increased CACNA1C expression.},

Based on the serological findings of hypergamainmunoglobulinemia and positive anti-nuclear antibody tests, together with an abnormal cholangiogram, he was diagnosed with overlap syndrome (AIH-PSC). Liver imaging revealed innumerable liver masses with a benign appearance in the pathological evaluation. To rule out the colon abnormalities that usually coexist with such liver masses, colonoscopy was performed and showed no significant changes. The liver masses were nonmalignant and were resolved after immunosuppressant therapy. CONCLUSIONS Because AIH-PSC overlap syndrome is rare, it is suggested that radiological evaluation of the biliary tree should be performed routinely in adults diagnosed with AIH to reduce the missed diagnosis of overlap syndrome and liver masses.},

    abstract = {Alport syndrome (AS) is a heterogeneous basement membrane disease characterised by haematuria with progressive hereditary nephritis, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and pathognomonic ocular lesions. It is one of the spectra of diseases representing hereditary nephritis, which inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Microscopic or frank haematuria persistent from childhood constitutes the clinical clue for its early recognition. It occurs as a result of genetically inherited or de novo mutations in type IV collagen genes. The most common mode of inheritance is X-linked and men are more severely affected. We report a case of a young woman, in her fourth decade of life presenting with overt nephropathy, having persistent haematuria associated with SNHL and lenticonus with dot and fleck retinopathy on detailed clinical examination, diagnosed as a previously undetected case of Alport syndrome.},

Although previous investigations suggested that the IgM macroglobulin was secreted by the circulating leukemia cells, anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies raised to the IgM macroglobulin failed to react with the malignant cells in the circulation and bone marrow. In contrast, approximately 50% of the mononuclear cells from an enlarged inguinal lymph node reacted strongly with the anti-idiotype antibodies. Subsequent reanalysis of all cell populations demonstrated that whereas the circulating and bone marrow cells were IgM kappa-bearing, the macroglobulin was IgM gamma-bearing and the lymph node cells were evenly divided among IgM kappa-bearing and IgM gamma-bearing. Immunofluorescence flow cytometry indicated that those lymph node cells that reacted strictly with the anti-idiotype antibody were IgM gamma-bearing, demonstrating that they were the source of macroglobulin. An analysis of immunoglobulin gene DNA confirmed the coexistence of two distinct malignant B cell populations in the lymph node and indicated that the IgM kappa-bearing lymph node cells were identical to the circulating and bone marrow leukemic cells.},

However, the lesions responded rapidly to systemic steroid therapy. On the basis of lesional morphologic features, peripheral eosinophilia, and cutaneous histopathologic features, a diagnosis of Wells' syndrome was made. Wells' syndrome is extremely rare in childhood, with 27 pediatric cases reported in the literature. Because it is seen so infrequently, there are no specific guidelines for evaluation and management of Wells' syndrome among children. The diagnosis should be considered for children with presumed cellulitis and eosinophilia who fail to respond to antibiotics. Evaluation should include a directed history, physical examination, complete blood count, and stool testing for ova and parasites, to identify potential triggers. Treatment is with systemic steroid therapy unless disease is limited, in which case medium/high-potency topical steroids may be indicated. If systemic features are prominent or disease is chronic (lasting >6 months), then a referral to hematology/oncology should be considered.},

We present an unusual case of a 35-year-old woman with Friedreich's ataxia who presented with intermittent chest pressure associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis. Cardiac catheterization revealed a chronically occluded left circumflex coronary artery and a high-grade stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A Cypher stent, placed within the left anterior descending artery, left no residual stenosis. This case illustrates the importance of fully investigating anginal symptoms in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, because coronary artery disease is likely underdiagnosed in this population. Early diagnosis may permit aggressive management and may delay the progression to end-stage cardiomyopathy.},

There was a marked deficiency of muscle total carnitine and a mild deficiency of hepatic total carnitine. Unlike patients with systemic carnitine deficiency, serum and muscle long-chain acylcarnitine were elevated and renal reabsorption of carnitine was normal. It was postulated that the defect in long-chain fatty acid oxidation in this disorder is caused by an abnormality in the mitochondrial acylcarnitine transport. Detailed studies of the cause of the hypoglycemia revealed that insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, and glucagon secretion were appropriate and that it is unlikely that there was a major deficiency of a glycolytic or gluconeogenic enzyme. Glucose production and alanine conversion to glucose were in the low normal range when compared to normal children in the postabsorptive state. The hypoglycemia in our patients was probably due to a modest increase in glucose consumption, secondary to the decreased oxidation of fatty acids and ketones, alternate fuels which spare glucose utilization, plus a modest decrease in hepatic glucose production secondary to decreased available hepatic energy substrates.},

The rapidly deteriorating heart failure and other systemic complications remitted on pulse corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy.

    abstract = {Graves disease is rarely complicated with cerebrovascular steno-occlusive diseases. Previous studies have suggested several hypotheses for this occurrence, including excess thyroid hormone, which stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn causes an abnormal hemodynamic response with consequent atherosclerotic changes, and antithyroid antibodies cause local vascular inflammation in patients with Graves disease. However, radiological findings of vasculitis in patients with Graves disease and cerebral infarction remain less known. We report the case of a 30-year-old Japanese woman with acute cerebral infarction due to vasculitis associated with Graves disease. She was admitted to our hospital with a 4-day history of intermittent transient dysarthria and limb shaking of the left leg when standing. Three weeks before admission, she went to a local hospital because of general malaise and was diagnosed with Graves disease. Neurological examination revealed paralytic dysarthria, left central facial nerve palsy, and left hemiparesis (manual muscle testing, 4 of 5). Blood examinations showed hyperthyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone ≤.010 µU/mL; free T3 ≥25.0 pg/mL; free T4 ≥8.0 ng/dL) and elevation of antithyroid antibody levels (thyroid peroxidase antibody, 87 IU/mL). The vessel wall of the right internal carotid artery was markedly enhanced on contrast-enhanced three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, suggesting vasculitis. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed right internal carotid artery occlusion after the branching ophthalmic artery. Arterial stenosis due to vasculitis was considered the cause of hemodynamic ischemic stroke. Vessel wall imaging such as high-resolution contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging seems useful for assessing the underlying mechanism of stroke in patients with Graves disease.},

    abstract = {Alkaptonuria is a rare disease of phenylalanine, aromatic amino acids, and tyrosine metabolism. Because of a genetic deficiency of the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, an accumulation of homogentisic acid causes ochronotic pigment deposition. The most common clinical manifestations are arthropathy, urinary calculi and discoloration, cutaneous and cartilaginous pigmentation, and cardiac valvular disease. Arthropathy and aortic stenosis are the most debilitating manifestations of the disease. A case of alkaptonuric aortic stenosis is described. A 75-year-old woman with a history of alkaptonuria presented in the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea. Upon examination, the patient was hypertensive, tachypneic, and tachycardic with premature ventricular contractions. She had pitting edema of the lower extremities and complaints of generalized weakness. Chest x-rays revealed congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diuretics were administered, and a continuous nitroglycerin infusion was initiated in the emergency department. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. The patient's respiratory status continued to decline. She was intubated endotracheally 1 day after admission. Subsequent cardiac evaluation revealed an ejection fraction of 35%, severe aortic stenosis, mild coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and anteroapical akinesis. A dobutamine infusion was instituted for persistent hypotension, and renal dose dopamine was initiated for oliguric renal failure. The patient underwent an emergency operation for an aortic valve replacement with a Dacron patch 10 days after admission. Cardiopulmonary bypass and mild hypothermia were used during the procedure. The patient's hemodynamic status remained tenuous throughout the procedure. Although the first attempt to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass failed, the second attempt was successful with the aid of an intra-aortic balloon pump, inotropic support, and atrioventricular pacing. These measures were maintained during transport to the surgical intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, the patient did not have an audible blood pressure or a palpable pulse without the support of the intra-aortic balloon pump and atrioventricular pacing. Coarse atrial fibrillation was the underlying electrocardiogram rhythm in the absence of atrioventricular pacing. Sodium bicarbonate was given without improvement. After discussion with the family, all life support measures were discontinued. The patient died 10 minutes after her arrival in the intensive care unit. Alkaptonuria's pathogenesis is manifested as both local and systemic in nature. Collagen vascular diseases share a similar pattern of multisystem involvement. Despite the negative outcome for the patient described, valuable insight can be obtained by studying this case and noting the anesthetic considerations specific to collagen vascular diseases in general.},

These metabolites were consistently present in urine samples collected in the boy's habitual condition after the attack. 1-[14C]-Palmitic acid was oxidized at a normal rate, whereas U-[14C]-Palmitic acid was oxidized at a reduced rate in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient, thus indicating a defect at the level of medium- and/or short-chain fatty acid oxidation. Riboflavin medication (100 mg three times a day) significantly reduced the excreted amounts of pathologic metabolites, suggesting a flavineadeninedinucleotide-related acyl-CoA dehydrogenation defect as the cause of the disease. Carnitine in plasma was low in the patient (6 mumole/liter, controls 26-74 mumole/liter), suggesting carnitine deficiency as a secondary effect of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency. The present patient, who presented with a Reye's syndrome-like attack, suffers from impaired dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA resulting in accumulation of acyl-CoA in the cells. Attacks with similar symptoms are seen in other acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiencies, such as glutaric aciduria types I and II, other types of C6-C10-dicarboxylic acidurias and isovaleric acidemia. Reduced flow through the acyl-CoA dehydrogenation steps may therefore be an ethiologic factor in Reye's syndrome. Several of the accumulated acyl-CoA's are toxic and may be responsible for some of the symptoms. The low carnitine level in plasma and the elevated esterified carnitine excretion in the present patient indicate that acyl-CoA accumulation may cause a functional carnitine deficiency by sequestration of carnitine as acyl-carnitines. As the inborn defect, systemic carnitine deficiency may exhibit symptoms like those of Reye's syndrome, it may be speculated whether functional carnitine deficiency in patients with accumulated acyl-CoA is another causal factor in the development of the symptoms during attacks.},

Summary of Case- We investigated a serial MRI data set of a 67-year-old woman with a plaque in the carotid artery at baseline and an ulcer at 10-month follow up. The lumen, plaque components (lipid/necrotic core, intraplaque hemorrhage), and ulcer were segmented and the lumen contours at baseline were used for WSS calculation. Correlation of the change in plaque composition with the WSS at baseline showed that the ulcer was generated exclusively at the high WSS location.},

Ataxia and hypoactive knee and ankle jerks prompted the analysis of the frataxin gene (FXN; 606829). The most common molecular abnormality: GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 was found with + 300 GAA repeats (1490bp) (normal individuals have 5 to 30 GAA repeat expansions, whereas affected individuals have from 70 to more than 1,000 GAA triplets). Electrocardiogram showed diffuse T wave inversion with sinus bradycardia, while ultrasound revealed concentric, symmetric hypertrophy of left ventricle leading to the diagnosis of hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. At the age of 14 years, the patient was bound to the wheel-chair, unable to walk. Her brother started to show ataxia at the age of 8 years, and subsequent analysis showed hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, too. His mutational analysis revealed the same frataxin abnormality, with + 300 GAA repeats. So far, no signs of diabetes occurred. The parents are heterozygous with FXN of 9 -10 GAA (490 bp). Both children received a beta blocker, while the girl's diabetes mellitus was treated by insulin preparations. This is a report of two siblings with Fridreich ataxia and hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, the girl developed type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

The case of a 3-year old girl is described, who was considered as autistic according to the criteria established by the DSM-IV manual for psychiatric disorders. She showed a delay in psychomotor development since she was 18 months old; she pronounces very few words (10), points to some objects, does not look up and it is hard to establish eye contact with her. She has paradoxical deafness and therefore, does not respond when called or when she is given orders, she is beginning to walk. She has not convulsions. Laboratory tests showed an anion gap of 31.6 mEq/L, lactate: 2.55: mmol/L, pyruvate: 0.06 mmol/L, and elevated lactate to/pyruvate ratio: 42.5. Under optical microscopy a muscular biopsy showed a reduction of the diameter of muscular fibers. The study of energy metabolism showed a partial deficiency of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain, which allowed us to conclude that this was a mitochondrial dysfunction with an autistic clinical spectrum.},

Mediastinal conglomerated lymph nodes were depicted in a chest computed tomography (CT) examination, and diagnosis of stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma was obtained after a lymph node biopsy. The antibodies against Purkinje cells (anti-Tr antibody) were positive immunohistochemically. Thus, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration depending on Hodgkin's disease was diagnosed. Despite the completion of chemotherapy, neurological recovery was not observed in the patient and plasmapheresis with immunoadsorption, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was performed. Truncal ataxia, gait disturbance, and tremors decreased. Consequently, we thought that plasmapheresis with the immunoadsorption method and IVIG therapy might be a treatment option for cerebellar ataxia caused by a mechanism of immune ancestry.},

The patient, a 70-year-old woman, with a previous history of myocardial infarction and subsequent coronary stenting, was detected to have multiple myeloma stage IIIa. She was started on Inj. Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)) and Tab. Dexamethasone 40 mg on a weekly basis. She showed good response to therapy. Three days after administration of the 22nd dose of bortezomib, she presented to the hospital with congestive cardiac failure. Echocardiography revealed a drop in the left ventricular ejection fraction from pretreatment levels of 45-50 to 25%. Patient was treated medically for left ventricular failure secondary to a suspected ischemic etiology. Coronary angiography revealed non-critical coronary artery disease with patent right coronary artery and left circumflex stents. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels that were initially raised 4,030 pg/ml (<125 pg/ml) declined to 2,280 pg/ml a week later and subsequently normalized over the next 2 weeks. The patient responded well to treatment and was then discharged. The left ventricular ejection normalized over the next 3 months. Cardiac side effects of bortezomib are not well reported. Elderly patients and those with preexisting cardiac conditions could be at increased cardiovascular risk. Since this risk increases once a cumulative dose of 20 mg/m(2) has been administered, patients need to be monitored more intensively once this threshold has been attained. Increased awareness of these cardiac side effects is necessary for patients' safety.},

Following resection of the atrial mass and tricuspid valve annuloplasty, a single saphenous vein graft bypass to the right coronary artery was performed.

The disease can be diagnosed based on the radiological findings. We present a 27-year-old women with five-year history of shortness of breath. She was diagnosed with PAM due to the presence of the characteristic chest X-ray and thorax computed tomography (CT) findings. We performed (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT imaging in order to detect any evidence of inflamation in the lung before deciding an anti-inflammatory treatment. The lung regions with dense calcifications revealed low FDG uptakes (SUVmax: 2.7) and the lung regions without calcifications showed lower FDG uptakes. No further treatment modality was planned besides inhaler salbutamol. Herein, we discuss this rare entity with literature search.},

    abstract = {We are usually unaware of the motion of an image across our retina that results from our own movement. For instance, during slow-tracking eye movements we do not mistake the shift of the image projected onto the retina for motion of the world around us, but instead perceive a stable world. Following early suggestions by von Helmholtz, it is commonly believed that this spatial stability is achieved by subtracting the retinal motion signal from an internal reference signal, such as a copy of the movement command (efference copy). Object motion is perceived only if the two differ. Although this concept is widely accepted, its anatomical underpinning remains unknown. Here we describe the case of a patient with bilateral extrastriate cortex lesions, suffering from false perception of motion due to an inability to take eye movements into account when faced with self-induced retinal image slip. This is indicated by the fact that during smooth-pursuit eye movements, he perceives motion of the stationary world at a velocity that corresponds to the velocity of his eye movement; that is, he perceives the raw retinal image slip uncorrected for his own eye movements. We suspect that this deficiency reflects damage of a distinct parieto-occipital region that disentangles self-induced and externally induced visual motion by comparing retinal signals with a reference signal encoding eye movements and possibly ego-motion in general.},

Histologically, the neoplastic biliary epithelium showed papillary growth in the dilated lumen. The tumor was diagnosed as IPNB, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia secreting abundant mucin.

Bortezomib is a boron-containing molecule, which reversibly inhibits the proteasome, an intracellular organelle, which is central to the breakdown of ubiquitinated proteins and consequently crucial for normal cellular homeostasis. Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that it is effective for the treatment of relapsed refractory myeloma. Acute development of congestive cardiac failure associated with bortezomib therapy occurs very rarely or may be underestimated. Inhibition of proteasome activity may impair cardiac function due to accumulation of unfolded, damaged and undegraded proteins in myocytes. Patients with or without cardiac disease or previously received anthracycline-containing regimes should be closely monitored when being subjected to treatment with bortezomib.},

She had to be defibrillated four times on her way to the hospital. The diagnosis of acute inferior-posterior infarction was made by electrocardiogram (ECG) and there was a markedly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) (including the MB fraction). The patient had a very low cardiac output and ejection fraction. A lung scan revealed possible pulmonary embolism for which she was anticoagulated. She remained hypotensive and hypoxemic and, on Day 17 of her hospital stay, she had a bout of severe dyspnea. A new systolic murmur was heard and the clinical diagnosis of ruptured papillary muscle was made and confirmed by echocardiography, and later at autopsy. All three coronary arteries were severely atherosclerotic and, in addition, the right coronary artery was completely closed by a thrombus. This case clearly illustrates the major pathological changes in the heart that correlate with the clinical findings in patients with a myocardial infarct that is complicated by left ventricular papillary muscle rupture. The pathophysiological effects of this condition, as illustrated in this case report, include the following:1. The posterior papillary muscle wa s almost completely separated from its base, with only a thin strip of muscle intact. The mistral valve thus was insufficient (a "flail valve''); this markedly reduced the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, increased its end-diastolic volume and pressure, produced a damming of blood in the pulmonary circulation, and this resulted in the pulmonary edema seen on the chest x-ray.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In contrast to Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS) and familial PGL syndromes, no germline or somatic mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunits A, B, C, or D have been found in most tumors and/or patients with CT. Nonetheless, the tumors arising among patients with CT, CSS, or familial PGL share a similar morphology with loss of the SDHB subunit on the protein level. For the current study, we employed massive parallel bisulfite sequencing to evaluate DNA methylation patterns in CpG islands in proximity to the gene loci of all four SDH subunits. For the first time, we report on a recurrent aberrant dense DNA methylation at the gene locus of SDHC in tumors of patients with CT, which was not present in tumors of patients with CSS or PGL, or in sporadic GISTs with KIT mutations. This DNA methylation pattern was correlated to a reduced mRNA expression of SDHC, and concurrent loss of the SDHC subunit on the protein level. Collectively, these data suggest epigenetic inactivation of the SDHC gene locus with functional impairment of the SDH complex as a plausible alternate mechanism of tumorigenesis in CT.},

Investigation of the pathophysiology of the exercise response in the patient revealed low maximal oxygen uptake (1/3 that of normal sedentary women) in cycle exercise and impaired muscle oxygen extraction as indicated by profoundly low maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference (5.8 ml/dl; controls = 15.4 +/- 1.4, mean +/- SD). The increases in cardiac output and ventilation during exercise, normally closely coupled to muscle metabolic rate, were markedly exaggerated (more than two- to threefold normal) relative to oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production accounting for prominent tachycardia and dyspnea at low workloads. Symptoms in our patient are similar to those reported in other human skeletal muscle respiratory chain defects involving complexes I and III, and the exaggerated circulatory response resembles that seen during experimental inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results suggest that impaired oxidative phosphorylation in working muscle disrupts the normal regulation of cardiac output and ventilation relative to muscle metabolic rate in exercise.},

In a patient with Leigh-like syndrome presenting with leukodystrophy and severe epilepsy, we identified a homozygous splice site mutation in COX8A, which codes for the ubiquitously expressed isoform of subunit VIII, the smallest nuclear-encoded subunit of complex IV. The mutation, affecting the last nucleotide of intron 1, leads to aberrant splicing, a frame-shift in the highly conserved exon 2, and decreased amount of the COX8A transcript. The loss of the wild-type COX8A protein severely impairs the stability of the entire cytochrome c oxidase enzyme complex and manifests in isolated complex IV deficiency in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts, similar to the frequent c.845_846delCT mutation in the assembly factor SURF1 gene. Stability and activity of complex IV could be rescued in the patient's fibroblasts by lentiviral expression of wild-type COX8A.

Duodenal involvement occurs in less than 5% of cases and often leads to clinically relevant strictures. However, fistula formation in the duodenum is exceptional. Herein, we report an unusual case of duodenobiliary fistula due to CD occurring in a 65-year-old patient who was successfully treated by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. This case report highlights the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha agents in the treatment of a bilioenteric fistula because it increases the probability of clinical remission and mucosal healing and therefore reduces the need for surgical treatment which may be associated morbidity.},

A 36-year-old woman experienced episodes of encephalopathy accompanied by lactic acidemia and had exercise intolerance and proximal myopathy. Histochemical analysis showed that 90% of muscle fibers exhibited decreased or absent cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity. Biochemical studies confirmed a severe isolated reduction in COX activity. Muscle immunocytochemistry revealed a pattern suggestive of a primary mtDNA defect in the COX-deficient fibers and was consistent with either reduced stability or impaired assembly of the holoenzyme. Sequence analysis of mtDNA identified a novel heteroplasmic G-->A point mutation at position 9952 in the patient's skeletal muscle, which was not detected in her leukocyte mtDNA or in that of 120 healthy controls or 60 additional patients with mitochondrial disease. This point mutation is located in the 3' end of the gene for subunit III of COX and is predicted to result in the loss of the last 13 amino acids of the highly conserved C-terminal region of this subunit. It was not detected in mtDNA extracted from leukocytes, skeletal muscle, or myoblasts of the patient's mother or her two sons, indicating that this mutation is not maternally transmitted. Single-fiber PCR studies provided direct evidence for an association between this point mutation and COX deficiency and indicated that the proportion of mutant mtDNA required to induce COX deficiency is lower than that reported for tRNA-gene point mutations. The findings reported here represent only the second case of isolated COX deficiency to be defined at the molecular genetic level and reveal a new mutational mechanism in mitochondrial disease.},

Echocardiography showed apical HCM with preserved LV systolic function (LVEF=70%). Although dyspnea on exertion and leg edema improved rapidly with the use of diuretics, her symptoms soon worsened when daily activity was started again. In order to examine the effect of preload on hemodynamics, we performed a lower limb positive pressure test by compressing both legs using a household air leg massager. Echocardiography showed increases in mitral E velocity, E/A ratio and pulmonary venous D flow as well as decrease in stroke volume during the lower limb positive pressure test. Simultaneously-recorded pressure study also showed elevated LVEDP and increased v wave of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. These results suggested that even a small increase in preload led to elevation of LVEDP and symptomatic worsening due to severe diastolic heart failure in the present case. The lower limb positive pressure test may be useful for assessing the effect of preload on hemodynamics in patients with diastolic heart failure.},

Laboratory data showed leukocytosis, hypereosinophilia (10,450/μL), troponin T(+), elevated BNP, and markedly elevated eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (> 150 ng/mL). Echocardiography revealed diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30%) with increased wall thickness. Coronary angiography was normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging implied diffuse myocardial edema and subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement. Skin biopsy of purpura showed superfi cial perivascular dermatitis with remarkable eosinophilic infiltrations. No evidence of drug allergies, parasitic infection, or myeloproliferative disorder was detected. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis due to Churg-Strauss syndrome was considered. She was administered prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg, cyclophosphamide, and diuretics. Several markers of eosinophilic myocarditis and heart failure gradually improved, including ECP. She was discharged 30 days later with no cardiac event. Eosinophilic myocarditis is characterized by predominantly eosinophilic infi ltration. Eosinophilic granule proteins, such as ECP and major basic protein, play important roles in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic myocarditis. We experienced a rare case of eosinophilic myocarditis due to Churg-Strauss syndrome. Markedly elevated ECP played an important role in the early diagnosis and subsequent reduction in ECP served as a marker of monitoring. In an asthmatic patient with dyspnea, hypereosinophilia, and vasculitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome with eosinophilic myocarditis should be considered.},

The absence of electrophysiological change despite left stellate block is disconcerting and re-emphasises our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of syndromes involving long QT intervals.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, complicating idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, is a very uncommon association, with only 2 reported cases in the literature. We present a 69-year-old healthy woman presenting with petechial rash, progressive dyspnea, and bilateral alveolar infiltrates. She was found to have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient had an excellent response to high doses of pulse steroids and immunoglobulins. A high index of suspicion for noninfectious pulmonary diseases should be considered in patients with autoimmune diseases presenting with pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxia. Flexible bronchoscopy with sequential lavage is a relatively safe procedure in patients with coagulopathy and should be attempted to detect and confirm the diagnosis; absence of hemoptysis should not preclude the diagnosis.},

The underlying mechanism of cardiovascular alterations after SAH is linked to the adrenergic discharge related to aneurysm rupture. Cardiac and pulmonary complications are common after severe brain injury, especially the aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Acute neurogenic pulmonary edema is not exceptional; it may occur in 20% of cases and commonly follows a severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. Severe myocardial damage with cardiogenic shock may possibly reveal the SAH (3% of cases) and mislead to wrong diagnosis of ACS with dramatic therapeutic consequences. The contribution of CT and cerebral angiography is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical or endovascular treatment depends on location, size and shape of the aneurysm, on patient's age, neurological status and existence of concomitant diseases. We report the case of a 58 years old patient, with a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension, admitted for acute pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock.

Sequence analysis of the cytochrome b, which is the only mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit of complex III, revealed a homoplasmic G15498A mutation, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid (glycine 251 into an aspartic acid). The mutation was found to be homoplasmic in all tissues examined from the mother and her brother (lymphocytes, fibroblasts, hair roots and buccal cells). Complex III deficiency was also demonstrated in these cells. Nevertheless, the mother and the brother were asymptomatic. This mutation had been considered as a cardiomyopathy-generating mutation in a previously reported case, and its pathogenicity has been demonstrated recently in yeast. However, it seems not to fulfil the classical criteria for pathogenicity of a mitochondrial DNA mutation, especially the heteroplasmic status, and to be clinically silent, albeit present, in nonaffected relatives. We suggest that other factors are contributing to the clinical variability expression of the G15498A mtDNA mutation.},

In the proband, a homozygous 4-bp deletion was identified at nucleotides 338-341 of the cDNA predicting both a change in the last seven amino acids and an addition of a stretch of 14 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the protein. Both parents were found to be heterozygous for the deletion, which was absent from 55 controls. Low temperature (-196 degrees C) spectral studies performed on isolated mitochondria from cultured skin fibroblast of the proband showed a decreased cytochrome b content suggestive of a role for the QP-C subunit in the assembly or maintenance of complex III structure.},

Examination revealed a swollen neck and pharyngeal pseudomembrane. A throat swab was positive on culture forCorynebacterium ulcerans, with toxin expression confirmed on PCR and Elek testing. A diagnosis of classical respiratory diphtheria was made, with subsequent confirmation of the patient's domesticated dog as the source of infection. The dog had recently been attacked by a wild badger and was being treated for an ear infection. The patient made a good recovery with intravenous antimicrobial and supportive therapy; however, she subsequently developed a diphtheritic polyneuropathy in the form of a severe bulbar palsy with frank aspiration necessitating percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding. A mild sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy was also diagnosed. The patient eventually made an almost complete recovery.},

The purpose of this workis to find an association with Crohn's disease and cystic degeneration of a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.

Faced with this therapeutic dilemma, we aimed to maintain ketosis without compromising safety to optimize neurologic function and quality of life. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of a child simultaneously treated with the ketogenic diet and exogenous insulin. A 28-month follow-up revealed excellent glycemic control, improved activity level, significant developmental achievements, and, perhaps most striking, catch-up linear growth from < 5th percentile to the 50th percentile.

Prompt diagnosis of SSEH can be difficult due to the variety of presenting symptoms, which may resemble those of stroke. Patients who undergo hemodialysis (HD) are at risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation during dialysis and uremia. However, SSEH in HD patients undergoing HD has rarely been reported. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old Japanese man, who has been undergoing maintenance HD for the previous three years, was admitted to Kariya Toyota General Hospital, Aichi, Japan, with acute chest and abdominal pain, and with complete paraplegia. The patient denied any recent trauma or medical procedures. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an extensive hematoma in the thoracic and lumbar epidural space, extending from T8 to L5. The patient's symptoms improved within three hours following hospital admission, and after three days without HD treatment, the SSEH decreased in size, and the patient successfully recovered without residual neurological deficits and without requiring surgery. CONCLUSIONS The management of SSEH in patients undergoing HD can be difficult, due to anticoagulation during dialysis and uremia. Prompt diagnosis and close neurological monitoring are important for appropriate management. In patients whose symptoms improve within a short period, conservative management may be considered.},

A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a cerebral abscess and the microbiology study showed a dark, melanin-pigmented fungus, exhibiting only sterile hyphae. This fungus was identified by the amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S RNA gene and of the adjacent internal transcriber spacer domains, ITS1 and ITS2, as Alternaria infectoria. Due to the impossibility of a surgical excision, and although several therapeutic strategies were attempted, the patient died. Limitations in the routine identification procedures and therapeutic options of this emerging opportunistic agent are highlighted in this report.},

Hemostasis of the resected stump is critical for the success of laparoscopic treatment. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. We suspected a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and performed urgent diagnostic laparoscopy. The gestational sac was implanted in the posterior wall of the uterus near the left uterosacral ligament, and bleeding from the gestational sac was noticed. We injected 3 ml of diluted vasopressin solution (0.4 U/ml) directly into the gestational sac and into the posterior uterine wall around the gestational sac. Thereafter, we could resect the gestational product using an ultrasonically activated scalpel. Additional hemostasis in the resected stump was not required. CONCLUSIONS We believe that a local injection of a diluted vasopressin solution helps in maintaining the hemostasis after the laparoscopic resection of the implanted gestational sac in cases of abdominal pregnancy.},

    abstract = {Adipsic (or essential) hypernatremia is a rare hypernatremia caused by a deficiency in thirst regulation and vasopressin release. In 2010, we reported a case in which autoantibodies targeting the sensory circumventricular organs (sCVOs) caused adipsic hypernatremia without hypothalamic structural lesions demonstrable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); sCVOs include the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), which are centers for the monitoring of body-fluid conditions and the control of water and salt intakes, and harbor neurons innervating hypothalamic nuclei for vasopressin release. We herein report three newly identified patients (3- to 8-year-old girls on the first visit) with similar symptoms. The common features of the patients were extensive hypernatremia without any sensation of thirst and defects in vasopressin response to serum hypertonicity. Despite these features, we could not detect any hypothalamic structural lesions by MRI. Immunohistochemical analyses using the sera of the three patients revealed that antibodies specifically reactive to the mouse SFO were present in the sera of all cases; in one case, the antibodies also reacted with the mouse OVLT. The immunoglobulin (Ig) fraction of serum obtained from one patient was intravenously injected into wild-type mice to determine whether the mice developed similar symptoms. Mice injected with a patient's Ig showed abnormalities in water/salt intake, vasopressin release, and diuresis, which resultantly developed hypernatremia. Prominent cell death and infiltration of reactive microglia was observed in the SFO of these mice. Thus, autoimmune destruction of the SFO may be the cause of the adipsic hypernatremia. This study provides a possible explanation for the pathogenesis of adipsic hypernatremia without demonstrable hypothalamus-pituitary lesions.},

A laser-assisted angle selection system was custom fabricated and used during a CT-guided lung biopsy. Off-target error was measured comparing standard methods to the laser method while pointing towards the target from the skin. The difference between the planned angle and selected angle using the laser-assisted system was 2°, improved from 12° with the standard method. Although yet to be confirmed, laser-assisted angle selection systems may improve the accuracy of needle placement, which may translate into improved outcomes for certain needle based procedures.},

In contrast to the classic EATL type I, EATL type II occurs sporadically, is unrelated to celiac disease, and comprises 10% to 20% of all EATL cases. A total of five cases of EATL type II were diagnosed at our clinic from January 2009 to September 2012. Four of the five patients were diagnosed with the help of endoscopy. Among the four patients, two of the cases involved both the small and large intestines, whereas in the other two patients, EATL was limited to the small intestine. Common endoscopic findings included innumerable fine granularities (also called mosaic mucosal patterns) and diffuse thickening of the mucosa with a semicircular shallow ulceration in the lesions of the small bowel. In contrast, the endoscopic findings of the colon were nonspecific and could not distinguish EATL type II from other diseases. There are only few published reports regarding the representative endoscopic findings of EATL. Here, we present the clinical and endoscopic findings of four cases of EATL type II diagnosed by endoscopy.},

These findings were suggestive of a copper metabolism disorder. In support of this, the patient's fibroblasts showed an increased copper uptake with normal retention. Detailed follow-up examinations were performed. Immunoblotting for several proteins including ATP7A (MNK or Menkes protein), ATP7B (Wilson protein) and SOD1 showed normal results, implying a copper metabolism defect other than Wilson or Menkes disease. Sequence analysis of ATOX1 and genes coding for proteins that are known to play a role in the mitochondrial copper metabolism (COI-III, SCO1, SCO2, COX11, COX17, COX19) revealed no mutations. Additional disease genes that have been associated with cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency were negative for mutations as well. As beneficial effects of copper histidinate supplementation have been reported in selected disorders of copper metabolism presenting with low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, we initiated a copper histidinate supplementation. Remarkable improvement of clinical symptoms was observed, with complete restoration of cytochrome-c oxidase activity in skeletal muscle.},

PCR and Southern blot analyses were used to identify a 7658 bp duplication/deletion fragment.

Duplicated mtDNA was not observed in the mother and brother of the patient. Histochemical analysis of skeletal muscle demonstrated pathological accumulation of mitochondria in cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers. In situ hybridization demonstrated only deleted mtDNA in cytochrome c oxidase negative fibres.

The mean ratio of mutant mtDNA to normal mtDNA in cytochrome c oxidase-positive muscle fibers was 59%, whereas a mean ratio of 95% was found in cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers. The difference between cytochrome c oxidase-positive and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers was highly significant (P < 0.001).

The tissues and cultured fibroblasts of the patient with Leigh's syndrome showed a COX deficiency of systemic character. The decrease of COX activity to 5-11 per cent was accompanied by proportionally decreased content of the assembled COX enzyme. With the help of transmitochondrial cybrids derived from patient fibroblasts it was proven that the COX defect was of nuclear origin. In a successive pregnancy, the function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was analysed in cultured amniocytes by substrate-stimulated ATP production and COX activity was compared with the activity of citrate synthase. The amount and composition of OXPHOS complexes was estimated by two-dimensional (Blue Native/SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was verified immunochemically with specific antibodies. Three independent lines of evidence provided us with reliable data on the function of COX and OXPHOS in fetal cells which were sufficient to rule out the expected enzymatic defect within three weeks after amniocentesis.},

    abstract = {We describe a clinically full-blown MELAS patient, who had an A3243G point mutation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in muscle and blood cells, and his family members. From the proband two muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were analysed; one had typical ragged red fibers and focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and the other was completely normal. He also had a peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction velocity and sural nerve biopsy studies. Axonal degeneration, relative loss of large myelinated fibers and paracrystalline inclusion bodies in the Schwann cells were noted. Intriguingly, the A3243G mutation of mtDNA was not found in the sural nerve biopsy. Therefore, we conclude that tissue mosaicism is present in the muscle fibers and that the mtDNA mutation may not be detected in the nerve involved as proved by pathology. We also suggest that the involvement of specific tissues in patients with mitochondrial diseases should be further determined by single fiber mtDNA analysis.},

Therefore, management of patients with SSc-ILD remains a challenge. Here, we report a Chinese, female, SSc-ILD patient who was negative for Scl-70 and showed an excellent response to pirfenidone without obvious adverse effects. She had been suffered from dry cough and exertional dyspnea for 2 months. The chest computed tomography manifestation was consistent with a pattern of fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. The pulmonary function test showed isolated impaired diffusion. After 11 weeks of administration of pirfenidone, the dry cough and dyspnea had disappeared. Both of the lung shadows and the pulmonary diffusion function were improved. Pirfenidone might be an effective option for early SSc-ILD treatment. A well-controlled clinical trial is expected in the future.},

We present the classical radiological and endoscopic features and treatment strategy of a middle-aged female patient suffering from acute phlegmonous esophagogastritis complicated with hypopharyngeal abscess, esophageal perforation, mediastinitis, and empyema. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old Taiwanese female presented at our hospital due to fever, fatigue, painful swallowing, and vague chest pain for 5 days. She had a past history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, general weakness, chest pain, odynophagia, and a fever up to 38.9°C were found. Positive laboratory findings included leukocytosis (leukocyte count of 14.58×10³/μL, neutrophils 76.8%) and serum glucose 348 mg/dL (HbA1c 11.3%). A diagnosis of acute phlegmonous esophagogastritis with hypopharyngeal abscess was made based on typical computed tomography image features and clinical signs of infection. The patient received empirical antibiotic therapy initially; however, esophageal perforation with mediastinitis and empyema developed after admission. Emergency surgery with drainage and debridement was performed and antibiotics were administered. She was discharged in a stable condition on the 56th day of hospitalization. Six months later, a delayed esophageal reconstruction was performed. The patient has performed well for 9 months to date since the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Acute phlegmonous esophagogastritis complicated with hypopharyngeal abscess and esophageal perforation is extremely rare, and requires immediate medical attention. This report serves to remind physicians of this rare entity and the potential complications that may manifest with acute phlegmonous esophagogastritis.},

Hip fracture leads to pain and immobilization with complications ranging from delirium to functional loss and death. Although a mainstay of treatment is orthopedic repair, a multidisciplinary comanagement approach, including medical specialists and rehabilitation, may maximize patient recovery. Using the case of Mr W, an older man who sustained a fall and hip fracture, we present evidence-based components of care both in the hospital and outpatient settings. Preoperatively, clinicians should correct medical abnormalities and consider the appropriateness, timing, and type of surgical repair in the context of the patient's life expectancy and goals of care. Perioperative care should include prophylaxis with antibiotics, chemoprophylaxis for venous thromboembolism, and correction of major clinical abnormalities prior to surgery. Pain control, delirium, and pressure ulcer prevention are important inpatient care elements. Multidisciplinary models incorporating these care elements can decrease complications during inpatient stay. Rehabilitation strategies should be tailored to patient needs; early mobilization followed by rehabilitation exercises in institutional, home, and group settings should be considered to maximize restoration of locomotive abilities. Attention to care transitions is necessary and treatment for osteoporosis should be considered. The road to recovery for hip fracture patients is long and most patients may not regain their prefracture functional status. Understanding and anticipating issues that may arise in the older patient with hip fracture, while delivering evidence-based care components, is necessary to maximize patient recovery.},

A chronically low serum carnitine level (pretreatment plasma free carnitine 4 nmol/L, normal 37 +/- 8 nmol/L; total carnitine 8 nmol/L, normal 46 +/- 10) was assumed to be secondary and was treated with supplemental carnitine (30-50 mg/kg per day). Hypoglycaemia (blood sugar 35 mg/dl, normal 70-100), cardiomegaly, and fatty liver were also noted at diagnosis. The patient died unexpectedly at age 20 years. In retrospect, it was learned that the patient had stopped his carnitine without medical consultation several weeks prior to his death. Additional molecular investigations identified two mutations (R254X and IVS3 + 1G > A) in the patient's OCTN2 (SLC22A5) gene, consistent with a diagnosis of primary carnitine deficiency due to carnitine transporter defect. R245X is a founder mutation in Southern Chinese populations. It is unknown whether the original NAGS deficiency was primary or secondary, but molecular analysis of the NAGS gene failed to identify mutations. Urea cycle enzyme expression may be affected by fatty acid suppression of an AP-1 binding site in the promoter enhancer region of the urea cycle gene. Regardless, it is clear that the NAGS abnormality has led to delay of recognition of the OCTN2 defect, and modified the clinical course in this patient.},

A 69-year-old female was admitted because of acute inferior myocardial infarction; hemodynamically, she was in Forrester subset I. Cardiac catheterization performed 4 weeks post-infarction showed markedly increased left ventricular end-diastolic and pulmonary wedge pressures. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 66% with postero-basal akinesis and minimal mitral regurgitation. The right coronary artery was completely occluded with good collateral circulation from the intact left coronary artery. Doppler echocardiography 4 weeks post-infarction showed pseudo-normalization of the A/E ratio of peak mitral flow velocity in atrial systole (A) to peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole (E). Preload reduction by nitroglycerin increased the A wave. Ten months post-infarction, the patient was re-admitted due to congestive heart failure. The A/E ratio was unchanged, however the A wave no longer increased after the same dose of nitroglycerin. We have hypothesized that dehydration and/or the vigorous use of a nitrate, in the acute phase of myocardial infarction, masked an underlying restrictive cardiomyopathy which progressed in the 10 months post-infarction.},

We report a case of tension pneumocephalus in a preterm infant as a complication during HFNC ventilation. Significant neurological impairment was detected and support was eventually withdrawn. Few cases of pneumocephalus as a complication of positive airway pressure have been reported in the neonatal period, and they all have been related to CPAP. This report reinforces the need to be aware of this rare but possible complication during HFNC therapy, as timely diagnosis and treatment can prevent neurological sequelae. We also stress the importance of paying close attention to flow rate, nasal cannula size and insertion, and mouth position, and of regularly checking insertion depth.},

Left ventriculography showed a severely dilated left ventricle (ejection fraction 20%) and mild mitral regurgitation. In the myocardial scintigram using 99m-tetrofosmin, there was no viability in the posterolateral wall although the other wall was viable. Partial left ventriculectomy, which is called Batista's operation, coronary artery bypass grafting and Alfieri's mitral valve plasty were performed concomitantly. Postoperatively, the ejection fraction was improved to 39%, and all grafts were patent. The patient was discharged in New York Heart Association class I. We concluded that to succeed in partial left ventriculectomy for ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, not only should there be no viability in the posterolateral wall to be resected for volume reduction, but the coronary artery which perfuses the residual myocardium with viability should be graftable.},

We review the pathophysiology of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis in Addison's disease and how this is altered in the setting of hypertension and heart failure. An essential first step in management in both conditions is optimizing glucocorticoid replacement and considering dose reduction if excessive. Following this, if a patient with Addison's disease remains hypertensive, the fludrocortisone dose should be reviewed and reduced if there are clinical and/or biochemical signs of mineralocorticoid excess. In the absence of such signs, where the renin is towards the upper end of the normal range or elevated, an angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is the treatment of choice, and the fludrocortisone dose should remain unchanged. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are clinically useful as second line agents, but diuretics should be avoided. In the setting of heart failure, there is an increase in total body sodium and water; therefore, it is appropriate to reduce and rarely consider ceasing the fludrocortisone. Loop diuretics may be used, but not aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone. Standard treatment with ACE inhibitors, or as an alternative, AII receptor antagonists, are appropriate. Measurements of renin are no longer helpful in heart failure to determine the volume status but plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP/proBNP) may help guide therapy.},

On presentation, she exhibited right hemiparesis and left-sided visual loss, associated with amenorrhea. A massive (>5 cm) intra- and suprasellar lesion was seen on imaging, and her serum prolactin level was 4408 ng/ml. The patient received dopamine agonist treatment preoperatively for 4 weeks. To resect the tumor, a two-stage excision was required. Histologically, the specimen was composed of polygonal or spindle cells showing marked nuclear pleomorphism and/or multinucleation. Fibrosis was also focally conspicuous. Differential diagnoses included pituitary adenoma, pituitary carcinoma, pituicytoma, paraganglioma, spindle cell oncocytoma, and meningioma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for prolactin, chromogranin-A, and synaptophysin, but were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100 protein, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin. No apparent cerebrospinal or systemic metastases are found. Ultimately, prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma was diagnosed. Our case highlights the difficulty in definitively diagnosing an unusual prolactin-producing adenoma based on histopathology alone and the importance of referring to clinical information and immunohistochemical findings when deriving the diagnosis.},

Herein, we describe the first cytological report on ALK-positive LBCL in the pleural effusion. A 69-year-old Japanese male with a past history of malignant lymphoma of the cecum presented with progressive dyspnea and pleural effusion. Removal of the pleural effusion and aspiration of bone marrow were performed. May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain of the pleural fluid revealed abundant single or small aggregates of large-sized round cells. These cells had centrally-located large round to oval nuclei. The peculiar finding was the presence of pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, and some neoplastic cells had eosinophilic pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, which resembled "flaming plasma cells". Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the bone marrow demonstrated CD138(+), ALK1(+), CD20(-), CD79a(-), CD30(-), and IgA(+) large-sized neoplastic cells. Therefore, a diagnosis of ALK-positive LBCL was made. The peculiar finding of the present case was that most of the neoplastic cells had pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections, and some of them had eosinophilic pseudopodial cytoplasmic projections that resembled "flaming plasma cells", which has been recognized as the characteristic finding of IgA myeloma. Therefore, tumor cells that resembled "flaming plasma cells" in the pleural effusion may have had IgA in the cytoplasm. Albeit extremely rare, ALK-positive LBCL shows aggressive clinical course, thus, recognition of the cytomorphological features of this type of malignant lymphoma is important for early and correct diagnosis.},

However, the occurrence of MTX-related LPD in the gingiva is extremely rare. Herein, we report the fourth documented case of MTX-related EBV-associated LPD occurring in the gingiva of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A 76-year-old Japanese female with a 10-year history of RA, who was treated with MTX and infliximab, presented with a tumorous lesion in the gingiva. Biopsy of the gingiva tumor revealed diffuse proliferation of large-sized lymphoid cells with cleaved nuclei containing conspicuous nucleoli. These lymphoid cells were CD20- and EBER-positive. Therefore, a diagnosis of MTX-related EBV-associated LPD showing features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that occurred in the gingiva was made. Although the occurrence of LPD in the oral region, as seen in the present case, is rare, the prevalence of this disorder may be on the rise due to the increased number of patients undergoing immunosuppression therapy. Moreover, immunosenescence can also be a cause of EBV-associated LPD. Therefore, recognition of the occurrence of this disorder in the oral cavity and consideration of the clinical history can facilitate the correct diagnosis.},

Herein, we describe an additional case of sarcomatoid carcinoma with small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and review the clinicopathological features of this type of tumor. An 82-year-old Japanese male presented with hematuria. Computed tomography demonstrated a large tumor in the urinary bladder. Histopathological study of the resected urinary bladder tumor showed that approximately 80% of the tumor was comprised of small cell carcinoma, and the remaining components were spindle cell proliferation (approximately 15%) and squamous cell carcinoma (5%). Both the spindle cell and squamous cell carcinoma components were intermingled with nests of the small cell carcinoma. This is the fifth documented case of sarcomatoid carcinoma with small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Our review of the clinicopathological features of this type of tumor revealed that: i) elderly males are mainly affected, ii) the most common chief complaint is hematuria, iii) the epithelial component may include urothelial carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and/or squamous cell carcinoma, and iv) the sarcomatous component is composed of spindle cell proliferation. The histogenesis of this type of tumor remains a matter of controversy. However, recent molecular analyses demonstrated a monoclonal origin of both components. This theory can account for the various types of carcinomatous components in this tumor as seen in the present case.},

During the follow-up, an abdominal ultrasound scan revealed the presence of dense, bilateral perinephric infiltration. A computed tomographic guided core biopsy was performed in order to identify the histological nature of this lesion, and a morphological analysis demonstrated the accumulation of foamy histiocytes surrounded by fibrosis. The BRAFV600E mutation was detected, and a diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease was made.The extreme rarity of Erdheim-Chester disease strongly suggests the existence of potentially common element(s) that may have contributed to the pathogenesis of both disorders. Obviously, further studies are needed to clarify the mutual roles and effects of JAK2 and BRAF mutations in this patient, as well as their possible therapeutic implications.},

A heteroplasmic frameshift mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene was confirmed in the patient's skeletal muscle and blood. The mutation was not detectable in the mother's DNA extracted from blood or buccal cells. Enzymatic and oxymetric analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory system in the patients' skeletal muscle and skin fibroblasts demonstrated an isolated complex V deficiency. Native PAGE with subsequent immunoblotting for complex V revealed impaired complex V assembly and accumulation of ATPase subcomplexes. Whilst northern blotting confirmed equal presence of ATP8/6 mRNA, metabolic35S-labelling of mitochondrial translation products showed a severe depletion of the ATP6 protein together with aberrant translation product accumulation. In conclusion, this novel isolated complex V defect expands the clinical and genetic spectrum of mitochondrial defects of complex V deficiency. Furthermore, this work confirms the benefit of native PAGE as an additional diagnostic method for the identification of OXPHOS defects, as the presence of complex V subcomplexes is associated with pathogenic mutations of mtDNA.},

Of the four subunits, SDHA and SDHB are catalytic and SDHC and SDHD are anchoring. Mutations in SDHA and SDHAF1 (assembly factor) have been found in patients with CII deficiency and a mitochondrial phenotype. We present a patient with CII deficiency with a previously undescribed phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Also, a comprehensive review of 36 cases published in the literature was undertaken. The results show that CII deficiency has a variable phenotype with no correlation with residual complex activity in muscle although the phenotype and enzyme activities are comparable within a family. For some, the condition was fatal in infancy, others had multisystem involvement and some had onset in adulthood with mild symptoms and normal cognition. Neurological involvement is most commonly observed and brain imaging commonly shows leukoencephalopathy, Leigh syndrome, or cerebellar atrophy. Mutations in SDHAF1 are associated with leukoencephalopathy. Other organ systems like heart, muscle, and eyes are only involved in about 50% of the cases but cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and morbidity. In some patients, riboflavin has provided clinical improvement.},

A 57-yr-old male patient experienced head trauma. After 4 mos from onset, he exhibited impaired alertness, with a score of 7 on the Glasgow Coma Scale. At 40 mos after onset, the patient had a full Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. The lower portion of the ARAS was reconstructed using the probabilistic tractography method. On 4-mo diffusion tensor tractography, the fractional anisotropy and the tract volume of the lower portion of the right ARAS were lower by more than 2 SDs of those of control subjects. By contrast, on 40-mo diffusion tensor tractography, the fractional anisotropy and the tract volume values of the lower portion of the right ARAS were within 2 SDs of those of the control subjects. The increment fractional anisotropy and the FV value of the lower portion of the right ARAS on 40-mo diffusion tensor tractography indicated recovery of the injured lower ARAS. As a result, recovery of an injured lower portion of the ARAS in a patient with traumatic brain injury was demonstrated.},

    abstract = {Understanding genetic aberrations in cancer leads to discovery of new targets for cancer therapies. The genomic landscape of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been fully described. Therefore, patients with refractory advanced/metastatic HCC referred for experimental therapies, who had adequate tumor tissue available, had targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) of their tumor samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Foundation One, Foundation Medicine, MA) and their treatment outcomes were analyzed. In total, NGS was obtained for 14 patients (median number of prior therapies, 1) with advanced/metastatic HCC. Of these 14 patients, 10 (71%) were men, 4 (29%) women, 6 (43%) had hepatitis B or C-related HCC. NGS revealed at least 1 molecular abnormality in 12 patients (range 0-8, median 2). Detected molecular aberrations led to putative activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (n=3 [mTOR, PIK3CA, NF1]), Wnt pathway (n=6 [CTNNA1, CTNNB1]), MAPK pathway (n=2 [MAP2K1, NRAS]), and aberrant DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle control and apoptosis (n=18 [ATM, ATR, BAP1, CCND1, CDKN2A, CDK4, FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, MCL1, MDM2, RB1, TP53]). Of the 3 patients with molecular aberrations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, 2 received therapies including a mTOR inhibitor and all demonstrated therapeutic benefit ranging from a partial response to minor shrinkage per RECIST (-30%, -15%; respectively). In conclusion, genomic alterations are common in advanced HCC. Refractory patients with alterations putatively activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway demonstrated early signals of clinical activity when treated with therapies targeting mTOR.},

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the preferred agents for the treatment and prophylaxis of gastrointestinal injury associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or acetylsalicylic acid or both,1but recent data has raised questions about their association with negative cardiovascular events. We report 2 cases of patients with known CAD presented with chest pain mimicking angina pectoris that successfully resolved on discontinuation of the PPIs. One male and one female patient with known history of CAD receiving PPIs were referred to us with symptoms of refractory angina that was unresponsive to conventional optimized medical therapy. The angina was reported to be related to exertion in both the patients. Neither patient had a diagnosis of Prinzmetal angina or peptic ulcer disease; however, both patients reported a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Both patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy. No ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram were noted for either patient. Patient 1 had an exercise stress test that was negative for any inducible ischemia whereas patient 2 had no obstructive lesion seen on coronary angiography. Both patients reported to be symptom free after discontinuation of PPIs at 8 months of follow-up. It is our opinion that a relationship between PPIs and angina-like chest pain is plausible, as these 2 cases demonstrate the causative role of PPIs in precipitation of their symptoms. We postulate that this association should be considered in differential diagnosis of chest pain. In light of above findings we suggest that this is hypothesis generating and we are exploring the role of PPIs in patients with history of CAD and refractory angina-like symptoms despite complete revascularization.},

The patient was a 59-year-old woman, characterized by a circumscribed tubulopapillary tumor consisting of ciliated columnar cells, mucous cells, and basal cells, accompanied with peripheral abundant extracellular mucin. The tubulopapillary architecture with abundant extracellular mucin is mimicking adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7, thyroid transcription factor-1, whereas p40 and p63 highlighted the presence of basal cells. The ALK gene rearrangement was detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization and Ventana immunohistochemistry platform.

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), also known as Marjolin ulcer, is a rare complication of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Metastatic SCC from HS typically involves the axial skeleton or abdominopelvic viscera. Metastatic disease to the lungs is a rare phenomenon with only three reported cases of lung parenchyma. We present a biopsy proven case of metastatic SCC to the pleura from gluteal HS. CASE REPORT A 46-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed Marjolin ulcer secondary to gluteal HS was transferred to our intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to recurrent pleural effusion. On examination, patient was febrile (38.3 °C), normotensive (blood pressure 98/65 mm Hg), tachycardic (116 beats/minute) and tachypneic (40 breaths/minute) with oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. He was in moderate distress requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Chest examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally and skin examination was significant for 18 cm wide sacral lesion. CT thorax showed bilateral pleural effusions, pleural thickening, and scattered nodular densities within both lungs concerning for metastatic disease. Thoracentesis showed lymphocyte predominant exudate with negative cytology for malignant cells. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) illustrated thickened pleural rind with histopathology and positive p40 stain consistent with invasive well-to-moderately differentiated keratinizing SCC.  CONCLUSIONS SCC arising from HS is rare and metastatic disease to the pleura has not been reported previously. Strong clinical suspicion for malignancy is warranted in patients with advanced HS and evolving pulmonary symptoms despite negative cytology.},

    abstract = {Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a clonal disorder of bone marrow stem cells characterised by erythrocytosis. Diagnosis of PV requires exclusion of secondary causes of polycythaemia. It has been held that an elevated erythropoietin (Epo) level strongly indicates secondary erythrocytosis and excludes PV diagnosis, to the extent that the reduced serum Epo level is currently listed as a minor criterion in the WHO classification scheme for PV. However, patients with PV who co-present with Budd-Chiari syndrome have been documented with elevated serum Epo levels. For these patients, identification of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F point mutation along with the transient nature of the Epo elevation provides certainty of PV diagnosis, as illustrated by the proband. In this case report, the patient's positive response to cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea 500 mg daily) and phlebotomy (750 mL over three phlebotomies) further supports validity of PV diagnosis with elevated Epo. The patient remains on rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for treatment of her portal vein thrombosis.},

Reported here is a novel case caused by compound heterozygosity of SCO2. The child presented at the age of 3 weeks with failure-to-thrive, muscular hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and lactic acidemia. Leigh syndrome was diagnosed based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Immunohistochemical and enzymatic investigations on muscle indicated totally absent cytochrome c oxidase activity. Both parents had mild mental retardation. Sequence analysis in the patient and in his parents revealed heterozygous mutation c.418G > A in exon 2 inherited from the father and maternally inherited heterozygous insertion of 19bp at position 17 in the coding region of the SCO2 gene. Respiratory chain enzyme activity measurements indicated normal activity in both parents, although the mother's cytochrome c oxidase activity was lower.

The tumor showed the following unusual features as compared with the epithelial and mixed types of hepatoblastoma: (1) The tumor cells presented a primitive anaplastic appearance without any resemblance in terms of cytologic features or arrangement to embryonal or fetal liver. (2) Abundant mucoid material containing acid mucopolysaccharide was present giving a slimy, gelatinous, gross appearance to the tumor and its metastases. (3) Well-defined tubular structures were present in some foci within the tumor parenchyma. (4) The tumor resulted in a rapidly fatal course, with metastases to the lungs and widespread peritoneal seeding despite complete surgical resection of the primary tumor. Yolk sac carcinoma and undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma of the liver were considered in the differential diagnosis. On electron microscopic examination, the tumor cells showed cytoplasmic features and junctional complexes consistent with their epithelial origin. Alpha-fetoprotein in the blood, which was markedly elevated prior to surgery, returned to a normal level postoperatively. Hepatoblastoma with the combination of features described above has not been previously reported. Because of the two striking and easily recognizable features viz. total lack of differentiation of tumor cells and presence of abundant mucoid material, the authors designated the tumor as mucoid anaplastic hepatoblastoma.},

The patient presented with a uterine tumor showing histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural features of an extremely rare CS, with signs of melanocytic differentiation. The lesion was a 7.0 x 5.6 cm polypoid tumor mass arising from the endometrium and metastasizing in the abdominal cavity as a malignant melanoma - the most aggressive component of CS. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, she died 8 months after the initial diagnosis due to the metastatic spread of CS. In line with current knowledge, we assess the melanocytic differentiation as one of a hypothetic differential line with the ability of multidirectional stem cell differentiation. We discuss a possible pathogenesis of this lesion and the role of tamoxifen in the tumor development as well. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of uterine CS with melanocytic differentiation has been reported in the English literature.},

The non-O1/non-O139 serogroups ofVibrio choleraeoccur in diverse natural niches, and usually cause mild and self-limiting gastrointestinal illness. However, they have well-documented potential to cause invasive and extra-intestinal infections among immunocompromised patients. Furthermore, their ability to grow in low-salinity surface water, and the existence of asymptomatic human carriers, suggest novel acquisition routes for this unusual infection, even in people without obvious risk factors.Case presentation.A 62-year-old man presented with epigastric pain, vomiting and fever. The patient had a history of diabetes and cholecystectomy, although our initial examination did not reveal any significant findings that might indicateV. choleraeinfection. However, blood cultures subsequently revealed the presence ofV. cholerae, which was positively identified using both conventional and modern non-conventional technologies. The identity of theV. choleraeisolate was confirmed using Vitek MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS) and the FilmArray system, in addition to its initial identification using the Vitek 2 system. The septicaemia was successfully treated using a 14 day course of ciprofloxacin.Conclusion.The present case highlights the need to remain highly suspicious of non-O1/non-O139V. choleraeinfections in patients with known risk factors, as well as in healthy individuals with epidemiological exposure and compatible clinical symptoms. Special care should be taken to avoid false-positive results from confirmatory laboratory tests, as the organism can grow in fresh water, and the results should be verified using multiple methods.},

The patient, a 57-year-old African male was admitted at our hospital with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. He was found to have digital clubbing and decreased breath sounds in the right lower chest but no other significant clinical findings. His insulin level measured during an episode of hypoglycemia was undetectable. Chest radiograph and CT-scan revealed a lobulated mass in the right chest which was diagnosed to be SFT on histology. Surgical excision of the mass resulted in cure of the hypoglycemic episodes and rapid regression of the clubbing. Less than 65 cases of pleural SFT manifesting with hypoglycemia with or without finger-clubbing have been published in the English literature. The mean diameter of these tumours manifesting with hypoglycemia is 20 cm, 54% being benign while 42% were malignant.

PCNSL is an uncommon malignancy, particularly in young immunocompetent patients, and on MRI classically manifests as a homogeneously enhancing solitary mass with a predilection for periventricular and superficial locations, often contacting ventricular and meningeal surfaces. Tumefactive demyelinating lesions typically present as large white matter lesions with little mass effect or vasogenic oedema and "open-ring" enhancement, with the incomplete portion of the ring on the grey matter side of the lesion. PCNSL and tumefactive demyelinating lesions share some radiological features and thus, as our case report highlights, differentiating between them can be challenging.

Plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide increased significantly in both patients, allowing us to distinguish this disease from constrictive pericarditis which has similar clinical and hemodynamic features.

The former case successfully received heart transplantation, but the latter case died suddenly prior to receiving a heart transplant.

    abstract = {A 41-year-old woman with no modifiable coronary risk factors presented with a progressive exertional dyspnea. Chest radiography showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette with reinforced pulmonary vasculature in bilateral lower lung fields and both pleural effusion. Echocardiography revealed a dilated, globally hypokinetic left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 40%. Multislice cardiac computed tomography revealed abnormal origin of LCA from the main pulmonary artery receiving collaterals from a normally originating dilated tortuous right coronary artery. Coronary angiography revealed a single, large, and tortuous RCA arising from the right sinus of Valsalva and giving off extensive collateral vessels coursing over the right ventricular wall, the interventricular septum, and the apex to the left coronary artery that was drained into the proximal main pulmonary. The diagnosis of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) was confirmed. The patient underwent successful reimplantation of LCA to aorta after closure of the ostium (in the main pulmonary artery) of the anomalously originating LCA. After surgical and medical treatment, the patient's symptoms were relieved and both pleural effusions were improved on chest radiography. After then, the patient was discharged on medication.},

We present a case of cancer causing complete unilateral endobronchial obstruction with refractory hypoxia that improved with OLV strategy. CASE REPORT Our patient was an elderly male, admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation with worsening hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to lung mass and post-obstructive atelectasis. The patient developed refractory hypoxia on high conventional ventilator settings. Chest x-ray (CXR) showed opacification on left lung with ipsilateral mediastinal shift. Bronchoscopy revealed complete obstruction of the left main stem bronchus by a fungating mass. OLV strategy was then implemented. The patient had improved hypoxia despite unchanged CXR. CONCLUSIONS We propose that ventilating a patient with a complete unilateral endobronchial obstruction is physiologically similar to ventilating a patient with OLV. In such cases, OLV strategies may improve refractory hypoxia by minimizing V/Q mismatch and should be considered.},

Parenchymal atrophy was remarkable, especially in the pancreatic tail, and a dilated pancreatic main or branch duct was clearly found in the region. Moreover, pancreatic stones in the main duct were also distinctly proved. EUS may become a useful new diagnostic method in pediatric gastroenterology, especially when sufficient findings are not obtained by conventional imaging techniques. However, an ultrasonographic endoscope with a shorter rigid portion and smaller caliber should be developed for pediatric patients.},

    abstract = {We have reinvestigated a young woman, originally reported by us in 1983, who presented with exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis associated with severe deficiency of complex III and who responded to therapy with menadione and ascorbate. Gradually, she developed symptoms of a mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Immunocytochemistry of serial sections of muscle showed a mosaic of fibers that reacted poorly with antibodies to subunits of complex III but reacted normally with antibodies to subunits of complexes I, II, or IV, suggesting a mutation of mtDNA. These findings demonstrate the diagnostic value of immunocytochemistry in identifying specific respiratory-chain deficiencies and, potentially, distinguishing between nuclear- or mtDNA-encoded defects. Sequence analysis revealed a stop-codon mutation (G15242A) in the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome b gene, resulting in loss of the last 215 amino acids of cytochrome b. PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that the G15242A mutation was heteroplasmic and was present in a high percentage (87%) of affected tissue (skeletal muscle) and a low percentage (0.7%) of unaffected tissue (blood) but was not detected in controls. Analysis of microdissected muscle fibers showed a significant correlation between the immunoreactivity toward the Rieske protein of complex III and the percentage of mutant mtDNA: immunopositive fibers had a median value of 33% of the G15242A mutation, whereas immunonegative, ragged-red fibers had a median value of 89%, indicating that the stop-codon mutation was pathogenic in this patient. The G15242A mutation was also present in several other tissues, including hair roots, indicating that it must have arisen either very early in embryogenesis, before separation of the primary germ layers, or in the maternal germ line. The findings in this patient are contrasted with other recently described patients who have mutations in the cytochrome b gene.},

Clinical features can be nonspecific and include fever, dysphagia, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, sepsis, and embolic stroke a after recent history of RFA for atrial fibrillation. CASE REPORT  A 57-year-old Caucasian male was brought to the emergency department (ED) by his family because of an altered mental status. He had undergone a radiofrequency ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation three weeks earlier. Several hours after admission to the ED, the patient transiently became unresponsive and had a right sided hemiplegia. A brain MRI revealed multiple cerebral infarcts. On the following day, the patient had an episode of melena, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed which did not reveal any source of bleeding. While the patient was being monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU), he had an episode of hematemesis and went into cardiac arrest from which he was successfully resuscitated and transferred to another facility. He had another EGD, which uncovered a flap of mucosa covering the lower third of his esophagus and a 1 cm fistulous opening was seen with fresh blood oozing out of it. The patient had another cardiac arrest during the endoscopy and died despite all measures. CONCLUSIONS We present this case to stress the importance of early diagnosis of LAEF. LAEF can be fatal if diagnosis is delayed or missed. Early surgical intervention can reduce LAEF morbidity and mortality. Newer diagnostic modalities such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be helpful in cases where conventional imaging is unclear.},

Four cases have previously been reported where a patient has features consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome and a chromosome 14q13 deletion adjacent to, but not disrupting, NKX2-1. We present a patient who has a phenotype consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, featuring congenital hypothyroidism and choreoathetoid movements with gross motor delay. Thyroid ultrasound showed a small-normal gland and spontaneous resolution of hypothyroidism. Array CGH revealed a de novo 14q13.2-3 deletion adjacent to but not directly involving NKX2-1. Sequencing of NKX2-1 was normal. This report highlights a further case of chromosomal deletion adjacent to NXK2-1 in a patient with a phenotype consistent with brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, and confirms that array-CGH is a useful test in the investigation of congenital hypothyroidism. Deletion of the adjacent gene MBIP in most reported cases so far may be relevant to the pathogenesis of brain-lung-thyroid syndrome. Deletion of nearby promoter or enhancer elements acting on NKX2-1 could also be an important factor. However, further work is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of the brain-lung-thyroid phenotype in such cases.},

The skin invasion occurred 4 months after a "successful" treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Atypical presentation and diagnostic difficulties are discussed. Invasive cutaneous aspergillosis may be polymorphic. The diagnosis should be considered early in the etiological investigation of any suspicious skin lesions in CGD even in uncommon aspects such as burgeoning tumors.},

We report a case of a 53-year-old female patient diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis treated with azathioprine, who presented to the emergency room with a 6-wk history of fever and chills without other associated symptoms. Since the patient's fever was of unknown origin, she was hospitalized. All treatment was stopped and an extensive workup to explore the source of fever and chills was performed. Results of chest X-ray, viral, urine, and blood cultures, autoimmune serology, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no source of infection. A rechallenge test of azathioprine was performed and the fever and chills returned within a few hours. Azathioprine was established as the definite cause following rechallenge. Fever as an adverse drug reaction is often unrecognized. Azathioprine has been reported to cause drug-induced fever in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sarcoidosis. To the best of our knowledge there have been no previous reports documenting azathioprine-induced fever in patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The occurrence of fever following the readministration of azathioprine suggests the diagnosis of drug-induced fever, particularly after the exclusion of other causes. A careful rechallenge is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.},

Additional neurological findings included oculomotor palsy and ataxia of the left arm. On the radiological studies, a mass lesion (germinoma) was found on the midbrain tegmentum, which was treated by conventional radiation therapy.

With radiofrequency lesioning in the right Vim, his resting, postural, and action tremors were much alleviated in both the distal and proximal parts of the left upper extremity.

Histologic slides of the lesion showed a pituitary adenoma, marked by a proliferation of biphenotypic appearing cells, associated with a gangliocytoma, and marked by a proliferation of atypical appearing neuronal cells arranged against a glial-appearing background. Pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas are benign combination tumors that rarely occur in the sellar region. Adenomas in this setting are sometimes functional, and rare patients with mixed adenomas (adenomas secreting more than one hormone) have been reported. To our knowledge, there has been only one other report of a combined ACTH and prolactin-producing adenoma with gangliocytoma, reported in a patient who also had acromegaly. In our patient, the immunohistochemical stains demonstrated that the bulk of the adenoma cells stained with prolactin antibody, and scattered clusters of cells within the adenoma stained positively for ACTH. The adenoma did not stain with antibodies to any of the other anterior pituitary hormones. Postoperatively, the elevated prolactin and ACTH levels returned to normal levels and there was no evidence of residual tumor. Adequate sampling and immunohistochemistry are important in rendering a correct diagnosis and in identifying the hormone status of mixed adenoma-gangliocytomas.},

This tumor showed marked central necrosis and hemorrhage, and histologically diffuse sarcomatous cell proliferation associated with extensive osteoid formation and calcification of the periphery. Examination of the whole tumor and the cirrhotic liver (155 tissue blocks) showed that the tumor consisted of sarcoma cells mixed with osteoid with no region resembling hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma. Minute hepatocellular carcinomas were found in the cirrhotic liver distant from the sarcomatous area. On immunohistochemical examination, the main tumor gave a distinct positive reaction for vimentin, but not for keratin or other epithelial markers.

A 56-year-old woman was referred for a huge pelvic tumor, suspected to be an advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma. Intraoperative inspection revealed a mass, mainly located in the uterine myometrium, invading the uterine serosa. The tumor had previously spontaneously ruptured and disseminated to the pelvic cavity. Pathological and immunohistochemical examination revealed an infiltrative pattern of biphasic tumor cells composed of endometrioid adenocarcinoma and a nonepithelial component with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. Benign endometrial glands with stromal cells were found adjacent to the area of the carcinosarcoma. The endometrium and both ovaries and fallopian tubes were microscopically free of tumor cells. The final diagnosis was heterologous type carcinosarcoma with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation, originating from uterine adenomyosis.},

Successful recanalization and angioplasty of the occluded coronary artery resulted in a slow improvement of left ventricular function. Ultimate recovery of systolic performance (increase of ejection fraction from 16% to 48-51%) required more than half a year.

The effect of systemic chemotherapy on brain metastases after acquisition of EGFR-TKI resistance is limited, and thus far, whole-brain radiation therapy, which may cause the harmful effect on neurocognitive functions, has been the only established therapeutic option for especially symptomatic brain metastases. Osimertinib is a third-generation oral, potent, and irreversible EGFR-TKI. It can bind to EGFRs with high affinity even when the EGFR T790M mutation exists in addition to the sensitizing mutations. Its clinical efficacy for NSCLC patients harboring the T790M mutation has already been shown; however, the evidence of osimertinib on brain metastases has not been documented well, especially in terms of the appropriate timing for treatment and its response evaluation.},

All the tissues examined at autopsy showed decreased activity of all respiratory chain enzymes except complex II. The decrease in cytochromes b and a + a3 were in harmony with decreased enzyme activities in complex III and IV (CCO), respectively. All immunologically detectable subunits of CCO in immunoprecipitation were uniformly decreased in the cardiac and skeletal muscles, but subunits 1 and 4 were selectively decreased in other organs except liver. No large deletion could be detected in the cardiac muscle mtDNA after digestion with restriction enzymes.

The mutation causes alternative splicing resulting in a truncated protein and severely reduced levels of IscU protein in muscle tissue. Disease manifestations include muscle fatigability, dyspnoea, cardiac palpitations and episodic myoglobinuria. Muscle tissue of these patients demonstrates marked histochemical succinate dehydrogenase deficiency and accumulation of iron in muscle fibres, which are morphological hallmarks of the disease. A biopsy specimen from a patient, two months after a severe attack of rhabdomyolysis, revealed regenerating muscle with normal succinate dehydrogenase activity and only minor iron accumulation, whereas another biopsy obtained nine years after the episode showed the typical hallmarks of the disease. The apparent explanation for the normal succinate dehydrogenase activity during regeneration was a markedly increased level of IscU protein in regenerating muscle tissue and an increase in normally spliced ISCU transcripts in the patient. The results have implications for diagnosis of the disease based on muscle biopsy findings and support the concept that an increase of normally spliced ISCU by RNA modulating therapy may be a therapeutic possibility for these patients.},

A 77-year-old man with a pulsatile neck mass came to our hospital complaining of dyspnea and chest pain at rest; about 58 years ago, a gunshot accident had inflicted a penetrating bullet wound on the right side of his neck. Computerized tomography angiogram had demonstrated a huge vascular mass protruding into the right anterior neck with a pseudoaneurysm. The calcified pseudoaneurysm had an oval-shaped opening in the right common carotid artery, with a large base into the right internal jugular vein. Echocardiography showed deteriorating congestive heart failure, wherein left ventricular (LV) enlargement with a LV end-diastolic diameter of 6.1 cm, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, and LV ejection fraction of 60% was seen. The surgical approach was considered risky because of the severe deformity of the native vasculature, the severe calcified pseudoaneurysm, and the context of advanced age with congestive heart failure. Thus, we decided to treat this patient with endovascular devices. Fortunately, a stent-graft was delivered successfully across the carotid-jugular fistula and immediate follow-up angiogram demonstrated a small filling defect at the base of stent-graft representing thrombus. The follow-up computerized tomography angiograms obtained 2 weeks and 4 months later further demonstrated a patent stent-graft, no evidence of thrombus progression, and no abnormal shunt flow. The patient did not experience any neurologic complications nor did he show any evidence of pulmonary embolism for 8 months.},

To investigate the abnormal findings of persistent troponin elevation, septal hypertrophy, and heart failure we performed endomyocardial biopsies which showed widespread myocardial amyloidosis. Amyloid subtyping revealed transthyretin amyloidosis. This is the first case showing persistent troponin elevation in a patient with tranthyretin amyloidosis. Very few other cases have been published on the topic of cardiac amyloidosis and troponin elevation so far. Our case serves as an illustrating example in the differential diagnosis of nonischemic causes of persistent troponin elevation. It is important to consider cardiac amyloidosis in patients with troponin elevation and heart failure since the clinical management differs significantly from other causes of heart failure.},

The latter finding is particularly interesting because cardiac involvement has not yet been regarded as a major feature of Pearson syndrome. The diagnosis was proved by the finding of so far undescribed pleioplasmatic rearrangement of mitochondrial (mt)DNA (loss of 5,630 bp, 70% deleted and duplicated mtDNA) in blood cells. Our report demonstrates that patients with Pearson syndrome may also have impaired cardiac function. Thus, Pearson syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with left ventricular dysfunction of unknown origin and other clinical findings suggestive of a mitochondrial disease.},

We performed targeted sequencing of other telomere-related genes to identify the genetic basis of FIP in this kindred. The proband was a 69 year-old man with dyspnea, restrictive pulmonary function test results, and reticular changes on high-resolution CT scan. An older male sibling had died from IPF. The proband had markedly shortened telomeres in peripheral blood and undetectably short telomeres in alveolar epithelial cells. Polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing of NOP10 , TINF2 , NHP2 , and DKC1 revealed that both affected siblings shared a novel A to G 1213 transition in DKC1 near the hTR binding domain that is predicted to encode a Thr405Ala amino acid substitution. hTR levels were decreased out of proportion to DKC1 expression in the T405A DKC1 proband, suggesting this mutation destabilizes hTR and impairs telomerase function. This DKC1 variant represents the third telomere-related gene identified as a genetic cause of FIP. Further investigation into the mechanism by which dyskerin contributes to the development of lung fibrosis is warranted.},

TTC19 mutations constitute a rare cause of CIII deficiency and are associated with neurological disorders in childhood and adulthood. Herein, we describe a 27-year-old Japanese man with cerebellar ataxia, spastic paraparesis, loss of deep sensation, mild frontal lobe dysfunction and transient psychiatric symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cerebellar atrophy and bilateral high-intensity signals in the inferior olives and regions adjacent to periaqueductal gray matter, on T2-weighted images. On whole-exome sequencing, we detected a novel homozygous frameshift mutation c.157_158dup [p.Pro54Alafs*48] in TTC19. Mitochondrial enzyme assays confirmed mild impairment of CIII enzymatic activity in lymphoblasts, which was consistent with TTC19-related CIII deficiency. His symptoms and radiological findings demonstrated an early stage or mild form of this disease, and further clarify the characteristics of patients with rare TTC19 mutations.},

A 58-year-old male patient complaining of pain in the right lower quadrant was diagnosed with acute appendicitis and underwent an appendectomy. Histological examination of the resected appendix revealed goblet cell carcinoid. Infiltration of tumor cells beyond the appendix was observed and the surgically resected margin was positive for tumor cells. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was diffusely detected by immunohistochemistry, and cytokeratin 20, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A and serotonin were focally observed in the tumor cells. The expression of beta-catenin and E-cadherin was investigated to compare with that of typical rectal carcinoids (n = 3) and colon adenocarcinomas (n = 3). In normal colonic and rectal mucosae, beta-catenin and E-cadherin stained positive on the plasma membrane. In the case reported here, beta-catenin showed a preserved expression on the plasma membrane of goblet cell carcinoid; a pattern similar to typical carcinoids rather than to adenocarcinomas. However, E-cadherin demonstrated a reduced expression on the plasma membrane of the tumor cells. This staining pattern was identical to those both of carcinoids and of adenocarcinomas. These findings suggest the possibility that, in some cases, the adherens junctions of goblet cell carcinoids are similar to those of typical carcinoids rather than to those of adenocarcinomas.},

These were among 13 patients observed from eight to 10 years. Case 1: A 56-year-old man was diagnosed as having apical HCM at the age of 49 years. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy and prominent ST-T changes were observed on ECG during his first admission. His left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was 24 mmHg and a left ventriculo-gram revealed a decrease in the left ventricular cavity in the apex and marked hypertrophy of the apical wall. Moderate interstitial fibrosis without hypertrophy or disarray of myocytes was observed in a left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimen. In two episodes of cardiac arrest he was successfully resuscitated at the age of 50 years. At the age of 55 years, two-dimensional echocardiography revealed thinning and abnormal motion in the apical wall, and a defect in 201T1 accumulation was observed in the same region by perfusion scintigraphy. This patient was readmitted with a diagnosis of cerebral embolism at the age of 56 years. Cardiac catheterization revealed normal LVEDP (8 mmHg), and a left ventriculogram revealed an aneurysm in the left ventricular apex with normal major epicardial coronary arteries. He has been under treatment with antiarrhythmic medications, calcium antagonists and anticoagulants, and has become relatively asymptomatic. Case 2: A 69-year-old-man was diagnosed as having apical HCM after a complete evaluation, including cardiac catheterization, at the age of 59 years. His LVEDP was elevated (17 mmHg), and a left ventricular angiogram revealed marked hypertrophy localized to the apex. Ejection fraction was 64%. A left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy revealed interstitial fibrosis without hypertrophy of myocytes. Thereafter, he has been followed as a New York Heart Association functional class III to IV with occasional elevation of cardiac enzymes but without chest pain or acute changes in his ECGs. However, atrial fibrillation with complete right bundle branch block developed at the age of 60 years. Apical wall thinning and dyskinesis were diagnosed by 2D echocardiography and a defect in the 201T1 accumulation was observed at about 65 years of age. He was readmitted in severe cardiac failure at the age of 69 years, and he was diagnosed as having cardiac asthma with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 mmHg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In conclusion, rickets due to the renal Fanconi syndrome can be the first clinical sign of mitochondrial cytopathies without extra-renal symptoms. Elevated excretion of lactate and ketone bodies in urine may serve as a diagnostic marker.},

    abstract = {The existence of tumorspheres (TSs) might confer treatment resistance to pineoblastoma (PB). The existence of PB TSs with cellular immortalization potential has not yet been reported. We developed a procedure for isolating TSs from recurrent PB (rPB) and tested whether their properties made them suitable for use as a patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Immunocytochemical staining, RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR showed that, among stemness proteins, CD133, musashi and podoplanin were expressed at elevated levels in rPB TSs, but nestin was not. rPB TSs cultured under neuro-glial differentiation conditions expressed TUBB3, but not GFAP, MBP or NeuN. Unlike glioblastoma TSs, rPB TSs showed no clear evidence of invasion in 3D invasion assay or increased expression of genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. An orthotopic xenograft showed that tumor xenografts replicated the histopathological features of the patient tumor and expressed similar genome profiles, as determined by short tandem repeat genotyping. These data demonstrate the isolation and the characterization of rPB TSs for the first time. Using an orthotopic xenograft, we showed that rPB TSs could replicate the patient tumor, demonstrating their potential as a PDX for precision medicine.},

We experienced a 9-year-old girl having a familial MEN1 mutation.

At first, she was only diagnosed with insulinoma by abdominal magnetic resonance images of a 1.3 x 1.5 cm mass in the pancreas and high insulin levels in blood of the hepatic vein, but after her father was diagnosed with MEN1. We found she had familial MEN1 mutation, and she recovered hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after enucleation of the mass.

Recent advances in genetic technologies, specifically next-generation sequencing, now allow for the detection of genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in a systematic and unbiased manner. This is particularly important given the large clinical variability among pediatric cardiomyopathy patients and the large number of genes (>100) implicated in the disorder. We report on the performance of whole-exome sequencing in members of a consanguineous family with a history of pediatric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death, which led to the identification of a homozygous stop variant in the SLC22A5 gene, implicated in primary carnitine deficiency, as the likely genetic cause. Targeted carnitine tandem mass spectrometry analysis in the patient revealed complete absence of plasma-free carnitine and only trace levels of total carnitine, further supporting the causality of the SLC22A5 variant. l-carnitine supplementation in the proband led to a rapid and marked clinical improvement. This case illustrates the use of exome sequencing as a systematic and unbiased diagnostic tool in pediatric cardiomyopathy, providing an efficient route to the identification of the underlying cause, which lead to appropriate treatment and prevention of premature death.},

This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Air embolism can occur in a number of medical-surgical situations. Venous air embolism is frequently lethal when a substantial amount enters the venous circulation rapidly and can lead to significant morbidity if crossover to the systemic arterial circulation occurs. The diagnosis of massive air embolism is usually made on clinical grounds by the development of abrupt hemodynamic compromise. The true incidence, morbidity, and mortality of this event is unknown given the difficulties in diagnosis. CASE REPORT An inadvertent antecubital venous injection of 150 mL of air using a contrast power injector during a computed tomography (CT) is reported. Immediate imaging (CT) showed a significant amount of air in the right atrium and right ventricular cavity, and air mixed with contrast in the main pulmonary artery and proximal divisions of the pulmonary circulation. Patient condition deteriorated requiring mechanical ventilation for 48 hours. Condition improved over the next few days and patient was successfully extubated and discharged home. CONCLUSIONS Air embolism is a rare complication, the potential for this to be life threatening makes prevention and early detection of this condition essential. This condition should be suspected when patients experience sudden onset respiratory distress and/or experience a neurological event in the setting of a known risk factor. Treatment options include Durant's maneuver; left-lateral decubitus, head-down positioning; to decrease air entry into the right ventricle outflow tract, hyperbaric therapy, 100% O2 and supportive care.},

We describe a 31-year-old woman who developed transient heart failure during the acute phase of Kawasaki disease. The diagnosis was supported by the presence of all six criteria of the disease: fever, conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathies, truncal exanthem, and periungual membranous desquamation. Related clinical and laboratory findings included heart failure, arthralgias, transverse nail grooves, thrombocytosis, and elevated serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), and bilirubin. Alternative diagnoses were excluded. During her acute febrile illness, the patient developed tachycardia, hypotension, pulmonary rales, S3 gallop, and hepatojugular reflux. The chest roentgenogram showed new Kerley A and B lines. A first-pass isotopic ventriculography showed diffuse hypokinesia and decreased ventricular ejection fractions; spontaneous recovery occurred after a few days. A coronarography performed two months later showed no aneurysmal dilatation. Kawasaki disease is a cause, albeit rare, of myocardial dysfunction in the adult human, and should be sought for actively in a patient with heart failure during the course of an acute febrile illness, associated with mucocutaneous changes.},

We report a case of intramural hematoma in the gastric wall (GIH) secondary to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in a setting of platelet dysfunction. CASE REPORT This case study reviews the hospitalization of a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who was admitted for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral valve repair. During his complicated hospital course, he inadvertently required the placement of a PEG tube. His coagulation profile prior to this procedure was within normal limits. The patient had no history of coagulopathy and was taking aspirin 81 mg per day. PEG tube placement was withheld due to an expanding hematoma that was noted at the site of needle insertion in the gastric wall. A single dose of intravenous desmopressin (0.3 microgram/kilogram) was administered under the suspicion of uremic bleeding. No further gastrointestinal bleeding events were observed. A platelet function assay (PFA) and collagen/epinephrine closure time indicated platelet dysfunction. Three days later, we again attempted a PEG tube placement. His PFA prior to this procedure had normalized due to aspirin discontinuation and improvement of renal function. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed an area of flat bluish gastric submucosal bruising at the site of the previous hematoma. The PEG tube was placed successfully at an adjacent site. Over the course of the following month, the patient underwent uneventful feeding through the PEG tube. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, cases of GIH are rarely documented in literature. Multidisciplinary vigilance is required to maintain a high index of suspicion for this complication in patients with uremia or other coagulopathies to aid in prompt diagnosis.},

We found the patient to be infected by camelid HEV. This patient regularly consumed camel meat and milk, therefore camelid HEV, which is genotype 7, might infect human beings. Our finding links consumption of camel-derived food products to post-transplantation hepatitis E, which, if detected at early stages, can be cured with antiviral therapy and reduced administration of immunosuppressive agents.},

A 34 yr-old man who was a smoker, had a fever and a chronic cough. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed multiple tiny nodules in both lungs. The thoracoscopic lung biopsy revealed LCH. The patient quit smoking, but he received no other specific treatment. One year later, the follow up chest CT scan showed a 4 cm-sized mass in the left lower lobe of the lung. A lobectomy was then performed. Microscopic examination of the mass revealed an infiltrative proliferation of large cells that had malignant cytologic features. Immunohistochemical stains showed a strong reactivity for S-100 and CD68, and a focal reactivity for CD1a. We think this is the first case of LCS arising from LCH.},

Ureteral stones associated with hyperparathyroidism in the early course of MEN 1 are known to be its most common clinical manifestation; appropriate evaluation and close follow-up of patients with hypercalcemic urolithiasis can lead to an early diagnosis of gastrinoma. We report a patient with ZES associated with MEN 1, and urolithiasis as the presenting entity. A 51-year-old man visited the emergency department with recurrent epigastric pain. He had a history of calcium urinary stone 3 years ago, and 2 years later he had 2 operations for multiple jejunal ulcer perforations; these surgeries were 9 months apart. He was taking intermittent courses of antiulcer medication. Multiple peripancreatic nodular masses, a hepatic metastasis, parathyroid hyperplasia, and a pituitary microadenoma were confirmed by multimodal imaging studies. We diagnosed ZES with MEN 1 and performed sequential surgical excision of the gastrinomas and the parathyroid adenoma. The patient received octreotide injection therapy and close follow-up.},

All three patients are affected by a new segmental progeroid syndrome characterized by genomic instability and susceptibility toward early onset hepatocellular carcinoma. SPRTN was recently proposed to have a function in translesional DNA synthesis and the prevention of mutagenesis. Our in vivo and in vitro characterization of identified mutations has uncovered an essential role for SPRTN in the prevention of DNA replication stress during general DNA replication and in replication-related G2/M-checkpoint regulation. In addition to demonstrating the pathogenicity of identified SPRTN mutations, our findings provide a molecular explanation of how SPRTN dysfunction causes accelerated aging and susceptibility toward carcinoma.},

He was diagnosed with a displaced, isolated fracture of the lesser tuberosity apophysis for which he underwent open reduction and internal fixation. A combination of sutures passed through drill holes in the proximal humerus and bioabsorbable suture tacks were used to anatomically fix the lesser tuberosity fragment and subscapularis tendon. Postoperatively, he underwent a progressive physical therapy regimen. At 4 months follow-up, he had full range of motion, complete return of strength, and returned to competitive athletics.

MRA demonstrated no changes in the big extracranial and intracranial arteries. Since the clinical data and neuroimaging results suggested Sneddon's syndrome, the skin and skeletal muscle biopsy was taken to examine. The immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations of the skin biopsy revealed a significant reduction of the lumen of the capillaries and small to medium-sized arteries. Cells surrounding the vascular lumen, frequently with multilayer arrangement and their nuclei placed perpendicularly to the lumen, were CD31, CD34, and sporadically SMA positive. At the ultrastructural level, these proliferating cells showed typical features of endothelial cells: abundant intermediate filaments and Weibel-Palade bodies. Between the endothelial cells some junctions were detached as well in the capillaries as in the small arteries. The smooth muscle cells of the small arteries were electron denser than usual and their cytoplasmic protrusions penetrated to the endothelial cells. The ultrastructural picture of some vessels with a considerably narrow lumen was typical of vessels newly formed during angiogenesis. Neuroimaging including TC, MRI, MRA besides histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation may be useful for diagnosis of Sneddon's syndrome.},

Thyroid hormones, antithyroid antibodies and calcitonin were normal. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed mediastinal extension of the tumor and excluded the presence of lymph nodes or other tumors (T3N0M0). Total thyroidectomy was performed and histopathological evaluation revealed squamous cell carcinoma, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, showing diffuse positivity for CK7, CK19, CK34βE12, galectin-3, EGFR, focal positivity for p63 and negativity for TTF-1 and CD5. Subsequently, the patient underwent chemotherapy (Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, Epirubicin) and radiotherapy (40 Gy), but tumor recurrence was noticed one month after surgical resection and continued to grow despite treatment. Nodal and metastases status remained negative at regular follow-up. The patient died within one year after diagnosis. External radiotherapy and chemotherapy were not efficient in our case. New treatment options are needed to improve outcome in primary squamous cell carcinoma of the thyroid.},

In this study, we present a 31-year-old patient with abnormal vaginal bleeding. The diagnosis of SSCC was confirmed through pathologic examinations from hysterectomy specimen. Its epithelial origin was demonstrated by immunohistochemical studies. The expression of p53, HER2/neu, and c-kit was not enhanced in this tumor. Importantly, it was human papillomavirus type 16, positive by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization studies. Enhanced immunostaining for phospho-retinoblastoma protein and decreased apoptosis compared with the squamous cell carcinoma counterpart were observed.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole-genome sequencing demonstrated that the X chromosome breakpoint disrupts KDM6A in the second intron. No genes were directly disrupted on chromosome 5. KDM6A is a histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase and a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase. Expression of KDM6A is significantly reduced in DGAP100 lymphoblastoid cells compared to control samples. We identified nine additional cases with neurodevelopmental delay and various other features consistent with the DGAP100 phenotype with copy number variation encompassing KDM6A from microarray databases. We evaluated haploinsufficiency of kdm6a in a zebrafish model. kdm6a is expressed in the pharyngeal arches and ethmoid plate of the developing zebrafish, while a kdm6a morpholino knockdown exhibited craniofacial defects.

We describe the first case of malignant atrophic papulosisis with cranial nerve and peripheral nerve involvement in China. A 47-year-old woman presented to our hospital with atrophic porcelain white papules over the trunk and extremities, numbness in the right calf, vision decrease and impaired movement of the right eye. She was diagnosed with malignant atrophic papulosisis, based on characteristic symptoms and histopathologic examination. The patient was treated with dipyridamole and aspirin for 9 months, but later died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We reviewed currently available case reports on cranial nerve involvement in malignant atrophic papulosisis and emphasized the importance of skin biopsy in diagnosing this disease.},

    abstract = {Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a unique, aggressive hematopoietic disorder of infancy/early childhood caused by excessive proliferation of cells of monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Approximately 90% of patients carry either somatic or germline mutations of PTPN-11, K-RAS, N-RAS, CBL, or NF1 in their leukemic cells. These genetic aberrations are largely mutually exclusive and activate the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the therapy of choice for most patients with JMML, curing more than 50% of affected children. We recommend that this option be promptly offered to any child with PTPN-11-, K-RAS-, or NF1-mutated JMML and to the majority of those with N-RAS mutations. Because children with CBL mutations and few of those with N-RAS mutations may have spontaneous resolution of hematologic abnormalities, the decision to proceed to transplantation in these patients must be weighed carefully. Disease recurrence remains the main cause of treatment failure after HSCT. A second allograft is recommended if overt JMML relapse occurs after transplantation. Recently, azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, was reported to induce hematologic/molecular remissions in some children with JMML, and its role in both reducing leukemia burden before HSCT and in nontransplant settings requires further studies.},

We isolated a ceftaroline-resistant (MIC > 32 mg/liter) MRSA strain from the blood of a cystic fibrosis patient and five MRSA strains from the respiratory tract of this patient. Whole-genome sequencing identified two amino acid-altering mutations uniquely present in the ceftaroline-binding pocket of the transpeptidase region of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) in ceftaroline-resistant isolates. Biochemical analyses and the study of isogenic mutant strains confirmed that these changes caused ceftaroline resistance. Thus, we identified the molecular mechanism of ceftaroline resistance in the first MRSA strain with high-level ceftaroline resistance isolated in the United States.},

In order to successfully treat these patients, it is important to first identify these patients, treat them with aggressive combination therapy, and employ the use of aggressive long-term maintenance therapy. Future directions include the use of new immune-based treatments (antibodies or cellular-based therapies) as well as target-driven approaches. Until these treatment approaches are better defined, this review will provide a potential treatment approach for standard- and high-risk myeloma that can be followed using agents and strategies that are currently available with the goal of improving progression-free and overall survival for these patients today.},

    abstract = {CYP24A1 gene mutations induce infantile hypercalcemia, with high 1,25(OH)2D contrasting with low PTH levels. The adult phenotype is not well known. Two unrelated adult patients were referred for nephrolithiasis, hypertension, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, normal 25-OHD levels, and inappropriate PTH levels (22 to 92pg/mL;N: 15-68) suggesting primary hyperparathyroidism, leading to surgery. Hypercalciuria improved despite persistent hypercalcemia, treated with cinacalcet. The ratio 25-OHD3/24-25-(OH)2D3>100 (N<25) suggested the diagnosis of CYP24A1 mutations which were confirmed through Sanger sequencing. In conclusion, the adult phenotype associated with CYP24A1 mutations can evolve over time from hypercalcemia with suppressed PTH towards hyperparathyroidism with moderately increased PTH level, adenoma and/or slightly increased parathyroid glands. Surgery decreased calciuria and improved kidney function. Cinacalcet was partially effective on hypercalcemia since PTH was inappropriate. This novel phenotype, a phenocopy of hyperparathyroidism, might evolve in few cases towards hyperparathyroidism despite random association of the 2 diseases cannot be excluded.},

    abstract = {In development of novel therapies for the treatment of patient with cancer, the use of radiotherapy (RT) can produce significant local control and, in recent studies, has also been shown to mediate anti-tumor responses at distant sites by triggering and enhancing the endogenous cellular immune responses. Although RT induces an abscopal effect in some patients due to enhanced immune response to the tumor, immune-escape mechanisms, including up-regulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells, limit this benefit in other patients. Hence, many studies have promoted the synergy of RT and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment for antitumor immunity. However, outcome may be improved when more therapies are combined, but risk of side effects can be increased.},

Although lateropulsion itself improved within two weeks, one patient's condition progressed to typical lateral medullary infarction. Lateropulsion caused by DSCT infarction could be a prodromal symptom of perfusion failure of a vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.},

The diagnosis and management are challenging because of the rare nature of this condition, the varied presentations and differential diagnoses, and the possibility of misdiagnosis. CASE REPORT A 25-year-old primigravida with scheduled induction of labor at 39 weeks gestation due to gestational diabetes mellitus presented for a routine antenatal appointment at 38 weeks and four days. On digital cervical examination, she was found to have a large semi-solid anterior vaginal mass, shown by trans-vaginal ultrasound to have a nearly solid appearance of a 5×7 cm mass with septation. Maternal Fetal Medicine and Gynecologic Oncology consultations were obtained primary cesarean section with vaginal biopsy in the Operating Room were recommended. Following an uncomplicated cesarean delivery and with the patient still under spinal anesthesia, the anterior vaginal mass was examined and found to contain 200 ml of purulent material. Because a diagnosis of urethral diverticulum was made, a biopsy was not performed. The patient was placed on antibiotic prophylaxis for the remainder of her hospital course. Follow-up CT scan confirmed a large urethral diverticulum, and she was referred to the Fetal Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) and Urogynecology units for treatment. CONCLUSIONS Early identification of urethral diverticulum during the pregnancy may allow for treatment and a trial of labor with vaginal delivery. MRI is the recommended imaging modality in identifying urethral diverticulum.},

This mutation fulfills all accepted criteria for pathogenicity.},

The predominant mtDNA abnormality was a 21.2-kb duplicated molecule. In addition, a small population of the corresponding partially deleted 4.6-kb molecule was detected. Skeletal muscle histology revealed fibers that were negative for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and had reduced mtDNA-encoded COX subunits. By single-fiber polymerase chain reaction analysis, COX-negative fibers contained a low number of wild-type or duplicated mtDNA molecules (ie, nondeleted). In situ hybridization demonstrated that the abnormal fibers contained increased amounts of mtDNA compared with normal fibers and that most of the genomes were deleted. We concluded that deleted mtDNA molecules were primarily responsible for the phenotype in this patient.},

Colonoscopy revealed a mass-like lesion. Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNCs) admixed by some eosinophils were demonstrated histopathologically. Immunohistochemical evaluation was positive for vimentin, CD34, smooth muscle actin, and ALK, and negative for CD117 and desmin. The tumor was successfully removed by surgery with no chemotherapy. No recurrence was reported. CONCLUSIONS We have performed surgical excision of the mass with no chemotherapy and no recurrence. Although recurrence is reported to be low, we recommend long-term follow-up after surgery.},

We present a case of a persistently ANA negative patient who presented with joint pain, rashes, mouth ulcer and alopecia. Clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus was made even though ANA was negative. She was started on steroids and went into remission. Later, she developed several episodes of convulsions associated with fever and prominent vasculitic lesions. The patient was also found to have microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Renal biopsy showed lupus nephritis class 1B. Due to the prominent skin lesions, we performed anti-extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) antibodies test and anti-Ro turned out to be positive.

We report here an analogous dissociation between overt and covert perception in a case of visuo-spatial neglect. The patient, P.S., had sustained right cerebral damage and failed overtly to process information in the hemispace contralateral to lesion. In common with most patients who manifest left-sided neglect, P.S. has a left homonymous hemianopia. Nonetheless, her neglect persists despite free movement of the head and eyes and is thus not a direct consequence of sensory loss in the left visual field. P.S. was presented simultaneously with two line drawings of a house, in one of which the left side was on fire. She judged that the drawings were identical; yet when asked to select which house she would prefer to live in, she reliably chose the house that was not burning.},

    abstract = {Barth syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by the tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutations and includes dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with left ventricular non-compaction, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, abnormal mitochondria and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non-compaction transmitted as an autosomal dominant condition has also been associated with LIM domain-binding 3 (LDB3) gene defects. We describe a family in which the 12-year-old proband had left ventricular non-compaction and DCM. His mother had five miscarriages, two other sons who died in infancy, and a healthy son and daughter. The proband showed left ventricular non-compaction-DCM, skeletal myopathy, recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic neutropenia. The DCM progressively improved with age; medical therapy was discontinued at 5 years of age. At present, left ventricular function is normal and arrhythmias are absent. Magnetic resonance imaging documented left ventricular non-compaction. However, oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic neutropenia have recurred. In the proband we identified two novel mutations, one of maternal origin in the TAZ gene (p.[Glu202ValfsX15]) and one of paternal origin in the LDB3 gene (p.[Thr350Ile]). The mother, brother and father are healthy; although the latter two show prominent left ventricle trabeculation without dysfunction. Expression studies of TAZ and LDB3 genes were conducted in family members and controls. In the proband, brother and father, LDB3 expression was similar to control cases. TAZ and LDB3 expression progressively declined with age in control both blood and myocardial samples. However, an endomyocardial biopsy performed in the proband at 6 months of age, showed significantly lower TAZ and LDB3 expression than in age-matched myocardial controls. We believe that the clinical, genetic and expression data support the hypothesis that tafazzins are essential during fetal and early post-natal life.},

A 13-year-old boy with an acute minimally displaced avulsion fracture of the anterior inferior iliac spine apophysis had initial symptomatic improvement with conservative treatment and a 3-month symptom-free period but then developed flexion-induced deep anterior groin pain and mechanical symptoms. Radiographs confirmed an inferiorly displaced malunion of the ipsilateral anterior inferior iliac spine apophysis in addition to acetabular retroversion and cam deformity. Surgical treatment, including arthroscopic spinoplasty, was performed. Despite some nonrestrictive heterotopic ossification, the patient had a successful clinical outcome at 18 months, with return to football, and a nonarthritic hip score of 98. Although anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fractures have historically been considered relatively self-limiting injuries, their malunion may be a previously missed cause of unrelenting or bimodal pain from secondary femoroacetabular impingement with possible degenerative consequences in young athletic patients. Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fractures may merit a lower degree of tolerance for displacement in the acute setting and a higher degree of clinical and radiographic scrutiny with surgical intervention, possibly in the form of arthroscopic spinoplasty in the more chronic one.},

His condition was often accompanied by ectopic junctional tachycardia with isorhythmic AV dissociation, which made him complain of palpitation by elevating right intra-atrial pressure. Although enhanced automaticity was the most likely mechanism of this tachycardia, it was abruptly initiated and terminated by a single premature contraction. Because this interesting character can not be explained solely by the usual ideas of automaticity, we suggest that ectopic junctional tachycardia in the present case may somewhat resemble the phenomenon of triggered automaticity.},

The fetus had been diagnosed with a large cervical mass which significantly extended into the right chest. The mass compressed and deviated the airway and major neck vessels posteriorly. Imaging also revealed possible tumor involvement with the superior vena cava and right atrium. The plan was for potential extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during the EXIT procedure (EXIT-to-ECMO) and the potential for traditional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for mediastinal tumor resection. A Modified EXIT-To-ECMO with Optional Reservoir (METEOR) circuit was devised to satisfy both therapies. A fetal airway could not be established during the EXIT procedure and so the EXIT-to-ECMO strategy was utilized. The fetus was then delivered and transferred to an adjoining operating room (OR). Traditional cardiopulmonary bypass with a cardiotomy venous reservoir (CVR) was utilized during the establishment of an airway, tumor biopsy and partial resection. The patient was eventually transitioned to our institution's standard ECMO circuit and then transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was weaned from ECMO on day of life (DOL) eight and had a successful tumor resection on DOL 11. The patient required hospitalization for numerous interventions including cardiac surgery at 4 months of age. She was discharged to home at 5 months of age.},

Although we have evidence of mitochondrial gene alterations in sporadic congenital cases, the origin of acquired forms [refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS)], is still largely unknown. Here, we report the analysis of respiratory chain function in a patient with a large mitochondrial deletion and in patients with RARS. A young boy with SA showed symptoms typical of a mitochondrial disease with metabolic acidosis, muscle weakness and cerebral involvement. His bone marrow DNA was analyzed for the presence of mitochondrial deletions. We found a new mitochondrial (mt)DNA deletion spanning 3,614 bp and including all the mt genes encoding complex IV, plus ATPase 6 and 8, and several transfer (t)RNAs. All tissues analyzed (liver, skeletal muscle, brain, pancreas) showed a heteroplasmic distribution of this mutant DNA. Bone marrow homogenates were obtained from five patients with RARS and from three patients with normal bone marrow and respiratory chain function assayed by spectrophotometric analysis. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity was greatly reduced in the patient's bone marrow. In contrast, CCO activity and global respiratory chain function were conserved in patients with RARS. We conclude that deficient CCO activity secondary to mtDNA deletions is related to intramitochondrial iron accumulation, as in our patient or in those with Pearson's syndrome, whereas other mechanisms, e.g. nuclear DNA mutations, have to be proposed to be involved in the acquired forms of SA.},

Here, we report the safety observed in four patients treated with autologous T cells that had been electroporated with mRNA coding for a CAR derived from a murine antibody to human mesothelin. Because of the transient nature of CAR expression on the T cells, subjects in the clinical study were given repeated infusions of the CAR-T cells to assess their safety. One subject developed anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest within minutes of completing the third infusion. Although human anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies have been known to develop with CAR-transduced T cells, they have been thought to have no adverse clinical consequences. This is the first description of clinical anaphylaxis resulting from CAR-modified T cells, most likely through IgE antibodies specific to the CAR. These results indicate that the potential immunogenicity of CARs derived from murine antibodies may be a safety issue for mRNA CARs, especially when administered using an intermittent dosing schedule.},

So far, mitochondrial diseases caused by isolated disorders of the ATP synthase have been shown to result from mutations in mtDNA genes for the subunits ATP6 and ATP8 or in nuclear genes encoding the biogenesis factors TMEM70 and ATPAF2. Here, we describe a patient with a homozygous p.Tyr12Cys mutation in the epsilon subunit encoded by the nuclear gene ATP5E. The 22-year-old woman presented with neonatal onset, lactic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, mild mental retardation and developed peripheral neuropathy. Patient fibroblasts showed 60-70% decrease in both oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The mitochondrial content of the ATP synthase complex was equally reduced, but its size was normal and it contained the mutated epsilon subunit. A similar reduction was found in all investigated F1 and Fo subunits with the exception of Fo subunit c, which was found to accumulate in a detergent-insoluble form. This is the first case of a mitochondrial disease due to a mutation in a nuclear encoded structural subunit of the ATP synthase. Our results indicate an essential role of the epsilon subunit in the biosynthesis and assembly of the F1 part of the ATP synthase. Furthermore, the epsilon subunit seems to be involved in the incorporation of subunit c to the rotor structure of the mammalian enzyme.},

This is a case report of a 50-year-old male patient who had received blood transfusions during coronary bypass grafting 9 years earlier. He presented in acute and chronic heart failure and, despite therapy, became moribund with multisystem organ failure. His ejection fraction was 10%. A Novacor ventricular assist device was implanted on May 19, 1995 (day 0). The patient received 44 U of blood and 20 U of platelets. Although his percent reactive antibodies (PRA) were negative before surgery by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the PRA 3 days after implantation of the ventricular assist device was 80%; it increased to 100% by day 7. In an attempt to decrease the PRA, intravenous immunoglobulin was given at 3-week intervals. The PRA became negative and the patient received a donor heart that was negative by fluorescence-activated cell sorter cross-match on day 64. On days 69-72, a dramatic increase in alloantibody activity was promptly reversed with additional intravenous immunoglobulin. Currently at posttransplant month 12, the patient shows no humoral, cellular, or vascular evidence of rejection.},

To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first reported case of an undifferentiated cardiac sarcoma metastasis to the spine. This previously healthy 18-year-old woman presented with a myocardial infarction. Investigations revealed a left atrial tumor, which was resected. Following local recurrence, the patient underwent extensive studies to rule out systemic disease. Orthotopic heart-lung transplantation was then performed. While receiving postoperative immunosuppressive therapy the patient presented with cauda equina syndrome secondary to metastatic tumor compression at the L-5 level.

Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb. The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in normal mtDNA. Both Pearson syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient. These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues.},

Despite its self-limited course and usually asymptomatic infection, some patients may present with a systemic illness mimicking multiple conditions and thus question the general state of their immune system. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old male presented to the hospital with fever, dry cough, and non-pruritic rash with no characteristic distribution for the past 10 days. Past medical history revealed that the patient had worked as a farmer three years ago, had abused cocaine paste over the same period, and also had in the last month presented to the hospital for acute appendicitis. Initial laboratory tests revealed hypereosinophilia greater than 10,000 eosinophils/mL. Infection of P. brasiliensis was confirmed by lymph node, skin, and colonoscopy biopsies. After treatment with itraconazole, the patient's eosinophil count returned to normal and his symptoms resolved. CONCLUSIONS Paracoccidioidomycosis may present as a systemic illness with only marked eosinophilia on initial diagnostic tests. Furthermore, in our patient's case, the high degree of eosinophilia may have contributed towards the patient's appendicitis in the weeks preceding the subacute infection. It is possible that the patient's history of working at a farm and abusing cocaine paste may have contributed to the initial colonization by the fungus.},

Although such large duplications (>10 bp) in the MYBPC3 gene are very rare and have been identified only in 4 families reported so far, the identical duplication mutation was found earlier in a Dutch patient, demonstrating that it may constitute a hitherto unknown founder mutation in central European populations. This observation underscores the significance of insertions into the coding sequence of the MYBPC3 gene for the development and pathogenesis of HCM.},

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed an extradural tumor located in the lower clivus, including the anterior aspect of the foramen magnum, deeply compressing the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord. Endoscopic endonasal surgery was performed via two nostrils. Since the basiocciput was destroyed by the tumor, removal of the tumor allowed identification of the middle clivus superiorly, the anterior arch of the atlas inferiorly, and anteromedial parts of occipital condyles bilaterally without drilling the basiocciput. The tumor was removed except for laterally and inferiorly extended lesions. Pathological diagnosis was chondroid chordoma. Postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged without further neurological deterioration. Endonasal endoscopic surgery provided safe and reliable tumor resection for a lower clival lesion. We believe that this minimally invasive procedure should be considered as an alternative to traditional surgical treatment.},

Some conditions act as a trigger for aHUS in individuals that have a genetic background predisposing to complement activation. Interferon β is a recombinant-protein therapy approved to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), and can be a causative agent in the occurrence of HUS through anti-angiogenic activity. In this paper, we briefly review aHUS clinical and genetic characteristics. Furthermore, we present a case of a 48-year-old woman, diagnosed with MS and treated with INFβ-1b from 2008. In December 2015, she presented with asthenia and loss of muscular strength in the legs and she quickly developed aHUS. Our case suggests that INFβ is a possible triggering factor for HUS.},

Diagnosis should be pursued with transesophageal echocardiography or catheterization. A 50-year-old man was admitted with symptoms of congestive heart failure. His functional capacity had declined over 3 years, worsening over the last 3 weeks. His medical history was significant only for gunshot to the right hemithorax, at age 25. He was found to be in distress, with signs of heart failure, S3 and S4 gallop, and systolic and diastolic murmur at the right sternal border. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 0.25, dilated left and right atria, and a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with an aortic-right atrial shunt. Left and right heart catheterization revealed metallic fragments in the anterior chest wall, normal coronary arteries, and a step-up in the oxygen saturation from the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery. Aortography revealed that the aneurysm had ruptured into the right atrium. Surgical repair was performed. Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm demands prompt diagnosis and treatment. Patients are often men, in the 3rd or 4th decade of life when rupture occurs. In our patient, the position of the bullet and its fragments, leaflet perforation, and lack of a predisposing infection suggest a causal association between the gunshot wound and the aneurysm.},

The main feature of KSS is progressive encephalomyopathy; on the other hand, PS shows fatal hematological problems in early infancy. Through Southern blot analysis of mtDNA of blood cells, deletion has been consistently found in patients with PS but usually undetectable in KSS patients. Therefore, their different clinical phenotypes have been explained by the different tissue distribution of mutant mtDNA. Recently, a few cases were reported which had features of PS in infancy and later developed KSS. These observations suggest that phenotypes may also be modified by the selection process involving mtDNA within different tissues. We found a case of KSS, who initially presented endocrinological dysfunction such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and had not developed external ophthalmoplegia until the age of 17. Although he did not show any symptoms of PS, a marked proportion of mtDNA was deleted not only in muscle but also in blood cells. Analysis of his blood cells showed an unchanged proportion of deleted mtDNA at three estimations within 6 years of the follow-up period. This case provides evidence that deleted mtDNA in blood cells also has a stable replicative capacity and that a large proportion of deleted mtDNA in blood cells may not accompany hematological problems.},

Incisional biopsy revealed that this mass included mature hematopoietic tissue compatible with extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The tissue also presented an extensive and diffuse infiltration by an atypical lymphoid population composed predominantly by small cells. The immunohistochemical study revealed that the atypical lymphoid population had a germinal center phenotype, consistent with the diffuse variant of follicular lymphoma (FL). The simultaneous presence of both EMH and FL in the same lesion made the interpretation and the final diagnosis of this case difficult. The presence of EMH in this clinical context may eclipse the diagnosis of the underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm. The close association between the tumor cells and extramedullary hematopoietic tissue in the absence of lymphadenopathies or other tissue involvement suggests a relationship of this tumor with the recently described primary FL of the bone marrow.},

Only a few reports have described the ultrasonographic features of bronchogenic cysts, characterizing them as nonspecific cystic masses with or without internal echogenic foci or debris. Therefore, it is hard to differentiate subcutaneous bronchogenic cysts from other subcutaneous cystic tumors ultrasonographically.We report a case of presternal subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst in an 18-year-old man with unusual ultrasonographic findings. Ultrasonography revealed a small, oval, cystic mass containing a well-circumscribed, heterogeneously hypoechoic, egg-shaped lesion in the dependent portion of the mass within the subcutaneous fat layer overlying the sternum.Surgical excision was performed, and the cystic mass was diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst. On pathological examination, the internal, heterogeneously hypoechoic, ball-like lesion was found to be mucous material within the cyst. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a presternal subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst presenting with a ball-like lesion inside of the cyst. This unusual ultrasonographic feature can be a clue to the diagnosis of subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst.In conclusion, if an anechoic cyst containing an internal, well-circumscribed, hypoechoic ball-like lesion is seen in the presternal subcutaneous fat layer, subcutaneous bronchogenic cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cystic masses.},

FDG-PET also showed a hypometabolism in the temporal pole areas with an abnormal finding on MRI in addition to the hypometabolism in cortical and subcortical regions.

Classic findings of acute encephalitis include altered mental status, fever, and new lesions on neuroimaging or electroencephalogram (EEG). We report an interesting case of a 61-year-old male with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with secondary involvement of the central nervous system (SCNS-DLBCL). He presented with acute encephalitis: altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, neuropsychiatric symptoms, multiple unchanged brain lesions on computed tomography scan of the head, and EEG showed mild to moderate diffuse slowing with low-moderate polymorphic delta and theta activity.

Infectious and autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis in patients with SCNS-DLBCL are not well documented in the literature, hence diagnosis and therapy becomes challenging.

It has been associated with mutations in MT-CYB, the only mitochondrial DNA encoded subunit, as well as in nine nuclear genes described thus far: BCS1L, TTC19, UQCRB, UQCRQ, UQCRC2, CYC1, UQCC2, LYRM7, and UQCC3. BCS1L, TTC19, UQCC2, LYRM7, and UQCC3 are complex III assembly factors. We report on an 8-year-old girl born to consanguineous Iraqi parents presenting with slowly progressive encephalomyopathy, severe failure to thrive, significant delays in verbal and communicative skills and bilateral retinal cherry red spots on fundoscopy. SNP array identified multiple regions of homozygosity involving 7.5% of the genome. Mutations in the TTC19 gene are known to cause complex III deficiency and TTC19 was located within the regions of homozygosity. Sequencing of TTC19 revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation at exon 6 (c.937C > T; p.Q313X). We reviewed the phenotypes and genotypes of all 11 patients with TTC19 mutations leading to complex III deficiency (including our case). The consistent features noted are progressive neurodegeneration with Leigh-like brain MRI abnormalities. Significant variability was observed however with the age of symptom onset and rate of disease progression. The bilateral retinal cherry red spots and failure to thrive observed in our patient are unique features, which have not been described, in previously reported patients with TTC19 mutations. Interestingly, all reported TTC19 mutations are nonsense mutations. The severity of clinical manifestations however does not specifically correlate with the residual complex III enzyme activities.},

Here, we report a case of a 74-year-old woman with diffuse infiltration of gastric adenocarcinoma (signet-ring-cell carcinoma/poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma) cells in the thyroid. The pathological diagnosis was made based on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy and fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid. An 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed multiple lesions with increased uptake, including the bilateral thyroid gland. On thyroid ultrasound examination, diffuse enlargement with internal heterogeneity and hypoechoic reticular lines was observed. On color Doppler imaging, a blood-flow signal was not detected in these hypoechoic lines. These findings were similar to those of diffuse metastases caused by other primary cancers, such as lung cancer, as reported earlier. Therefore, the presence of hypoechoic reticular lines without blood-flow signals is probably common to diffuse thyroid metastasis from any origin and an important diagnostic finding. This is the first report to show detailed ultrasound findings of diffuse gastric cancer metastasis to the thyroid gland using color Doppler.},

CASE REPORT A 53-year-old woman presented with progressive abdominal distention and irregular vaginal bleeding of several weeks' duration. A contrast CT abdomen and pelvis was significant for a mass in the lower uterine/cervical region, multiple peritoneal and omental masses, enlarged pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes, and large-volume ascites. A pelvic exam revealed a fungating vaginal mass, with biopsy showing a high-grade tumor with immunohistochemical staining positive for vimentin, CD10, and cyclin D1, consistent with endometrial stromal sarcoma. During her hospitalization, the patient became increasingly lethargic. Workup showed severe hypercalcemia and evidence of acute kidney injury. The patient did not have evidence of bony metastatic disease on imaging studies. Further laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated PTHrP of 301 pg/mL (nl 14-27), a depressed PTH level of 3 pg/mL (nl 15-65), and a depressed 25-OH vitamin D level of 16 ng/mL (nl 30-100), consistent with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient was treated with pamidronate, calcitonin, and intravenous fluids. She eventually required temporary hemodialysis and denosumab for refractory hypercalcemia, which improved her electrolyte abnormalities and clinical status. CONCLUSIONS Uterine malignancies of various histologies are increasingly recognized as a cause of humoral hypercalcemia. They are an important differential diagnosis in a woman with hypercalcemia and abnormal vaginal bleeding or abdominal symptoms.},

She developed respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She progressed to multiorgan failure due to decompensated congestive heart failure. Echocardiography demonstrated global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of <10%. Her cardiac function improved with fluid resuscitation and β blockade, and she was eventually discharged home. She was readmitted a few days later with pancreatitis after presenting with nausea, abdominal pain and hypertension. During hospitalisation she had paroxysms of headache, nausea and diaphoresis associated with hypertension and tachycardia. A CT scan of her abdomen revealed an adrenal mass and serum metanephrine studies confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After fluid resuscitation and sympathetic blockade her ejection fraction improved to 55%. The patient underwent an uneventful adrenalectomy and made a complete recovery.},

Laboratory data revealed severe hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. High normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), elevated mid-region PTH and undetectable osteocalcin levels had already been found before the appearance of obvious symptoms concomitantly associated with moderate hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia. Further, both PTH levels measured by two different methods gradually decreased until the initiation of magnesium supplementation. The magnesium supplement immediately relieved the tetany, and induced striking increases in both intact and mid-region PTH levels transiently and continuous elevations of osteocalcin levels. These results suggest that magnesium depletion has dual effects on PTH secretion, from stimulation to inhibition, as hypomagnesemia progresses. Both relative hypoparathyroidism and refractoriness of bone to PTH were thought to be responsible for hypocalcemia due to hypomagnesemia.},

Microscopically, lobules encircled by a fibrous envelope and cords or small cell nests in the stroma were noted. These two types of structures were composed of dark cells and clear foamy cells. The dark cells had large nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. The clear foamy cells had numerous lipid vacuoles, confirmed on immunostaining with anti-adipophilin antibody and electron microscopy. In the lobules the gradual transitions from basal dark cells to central clear foamy cells and comedo-like necrosis were observed. The tumor cells were positive on immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins (CAM5.2, AE1/AE3), Her2/neu and androgen receptor but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors. This is the first case of an androgen receptor-positive mammary SC to be reported, and therefore contributes to the understanding of the clinicopathological features of SC of the breast.},

The histopathological features in this form of myopathy were generally described as non-specific, i.e. moderate degree of type 2 fibre atrophy and excess of internal nuclei. We here present the clinical and histopathological features of a patient with Brody disease over a 19-year follow-up period. This patient had two heterozygous ATP2A1 mutations and complained about muscle stiffness immediately after effort. He had suffered from this since early childhood and exhibited clinical symptoms mimicking myotonia. Histological, ultrastructural and cytogenetic analyses revealed morphologically abnormal nuclei with polyploidy.

The activities of NADH-dehydrogenase (complex I) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) were severely diminished (20% residual activity of controls) in the skeletal and heart muscle. In the heart, succinate cytochrome c reductase (complex II/III) was additionally decreased to the same degree. Loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity was based on a reduction of both mitochondrial and nuclear derived subunits in the heart and diaphragm as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis, whereas the limb muscle showed a normal immunoreactive protein content. The results illustrate heterogeneous tissue expression of respiratory chain enzyme defects and demonstrate that a cardiomyopathy may be the leading presentation of a mitochondrial disorder in early infancy.},

This case indicated utilities and issues in measuring the ctDNA in cancer patients. CASE REPORT A 45-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer was treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel. The lung metastases were decreased but the meningitis carcinoma developed rapidly and she died. During the treatment with bevacizumab and paclitaxel, blood samples were taken serially and ctDNA was analyzed using a next-generation sequencer. TP53 frameshift mutation (TP53; p.Arg158fs with 7 nucleotides deletion) was identified in the tumor, and dynamic change in this mutation in ctDNA was observed in serially sampled plasma in this patient. We observed a rapid decrease of TP53 mutation at the beginning of treatment, then it increased as a sign of relapse. However, the high allelic fraction value of TP53 mutation was not consistent during the progression of cancer, suggesting that several factors affected the value of ctDNA. CONCLUSIONS Although this is a single-case experience, it strongly suggests ctDNA could be a modality to determine the cancer status in real time. However, we found that several factors affected the value of ctDNA. Further investigations are needed to reveal the significance of these very high-sensitivity changes.},

He received enalapril for cardiac dysfunction; however, he had worsening heart failure and was thus referred to our hospital. Echocardiography showed enlargement of the left ventricle, with a diastolic dimension of 77 mm and ejection fraction of 19%. His condition improved temporarily after an infusion of dobutamine and milrinone. He was then administered amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia; however, he subsequently developed hemoptysis. Amiodarone was discontinued and corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered followed by oral prednisolone (PSL). His creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level and cardiomegaly improved after the corticosteroid therapy. The PSL dose was reduced gradually, bisoprolol was introduced, and the catecholamine infusion was tapered. A cardiac resynchronization device was implanted; however, the patient's condition gradually worsened, which necessitated dobutamine infusion for heart failure. We readministered 30 mg PSL, which decreased the CPK level and improved the cardiomegaly. The dobutamine infusion was discontinued, and the patient was discharged. He was given 7.5 mg PSL as an outpatient, and he returned to normal life without exacerbation of the heart failure. There are similar reports showing that corticosteroids are effective for skeletal muscle improvement in Duchenne muscular dystrophy; however, their effectiveness for heart failure has been rarely reported.

A 66-year-old hypertensive woman presented with a 15-day history of tachycardia, dyspnoea and oedema. ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with ventricular frequency of 130 beats per minute (bpm). Echocardiogram showed dilated left ventricle (LV) with 0.39 ejection fraction. Angiography revealed non-obstructed coronary arteries. Heart rate and cardiac failure were controlled with amiodarone, digoxine, captopril, metoprolol and furosemide. During follow-up, despite drug dose optimisation, the patient kept complaining of tachycardia and dyspnoea with a ventricular rate between 108 and 120&emsp14;bpm. Medical staff suspected she was not taking her medicines properly. Two months later, the patient was asymptomatic and had converted to sinus rhythm (heart rate of 76&emsp14;bpm). Echocardiogram showed normal LV size and function. Patient's diagnosis was TIC. Although rare, TIC should be considered in all cases of systolic dysfunction associated with tachyarrhythmia.},

Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac MRI showed multiple intracardiac masses; the largest was filling most of the left ventricular cavity (figure 1A) (see online supplementary video 1 and figure S1), measuring around 2.8 cm×1.8 cm and arising from the apical septum. Left ventricular function was moderately impaired with an ejection fraction of 40%. Due to accelerated haemodynamic instability, the mass was excised surgically. Through left ventriculotomy, a large mass could be identified which was attached with a pedicle to the apical septum. This mass was excised with its pedicle.During early postoperative course, the patient developed subdural and intraventricular haemorrhage, necessitating insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. MRI of the brain showed dark-signalled subependymal nodules and multiple cortical patches of high T2 signals (see online supplementary figure S2). The patient had no neurological sequelae and was discharged home.The patient was discharged home with no neurological sequelae. During the 2-year follow-up period, serial echocardiograms showed regression of the rest of the cardiac tumours and improvement of cardiac functions (see online supplementary figure S3).

Biopsies subsequently revealed a highly aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) producing sheets of cells with an organoid distribution. The cells had abundant basophilic cytoplasm and a plasmacytic appearance. Although immunohistochemistry failed to show either B- or T-cell markers, antigens consistent with plasma cells were found. An immunoglobulin heavy chain clonal rearrangement was identified by PCR analysis. These studies were supportive of a diagnosis of a plasmablastic lymphoma. While awaiting the results of these tests, the patient was reinitiated on his HAART regimen. He was found on follow-up a month later to have complete resolution of his bulky mediastinal mass. He remained free of disease for 3 months with subsequent rectal and abdominal recurrence. Treatment with CHOP chemotherapy with filgrastim support was begun which resulted in another remission. Plasmablastic lymphoma is now reported in some studies to account for 2.6% of all HIV-related NHL. Originally described in 1997 in a series of 16 patients, this entity is highly associated with HIV infection in its later stages. Often, patients present with oral or jaw lesions with a rapidly progressive course. The tumors have the morphologic appearance of a plasmacytoid tumor with high proliferative index. Markers are positive mainly for LCA, CD79a, VS38C, and CD138. Co-infection with HHV-8 and EBV has not been consistently reported. Therapy with standard regimens has variable response. One case has been reported with a 3.5 year disease free survival. The regression of disease after resumption of HAART therapy alone in this patient suggests that HAART has an important role in the treatment of lymphoma in the HIV infected patient.},

Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 6-cm-diameter cystic mass between the porta hepatis and the pancreas head, which was diagnosed as a type I choledochal cyst. At 18 weeks of gestation, her upper abdominal pain became severe, and the size of the choledochal cyst increased to 12 cm in diameter. Laboratory data revealed a biliary obstruction. Percutaneous transhepatic drainage was performed immediately. She delivered a healthy male baby by elective cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation. At 6 weeks postpartum, the patient underwent surgical excision of the choledochal cyst, cholecystectomy, and formation of a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. Although choledochal cysts are rare during pregnancy, obstetricians should be familiar with the condition to ensure prompt diagnosis and adequate definitive management, given that the implications of missed or delayed diagnosis may be detrimental to both mother and fetus.},

A diagnosis of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency was made on the basis of metabolic and molecular genetic studies. Ventriculomegaly is a common referral reason for fetal MR, yet there are few published reports of the radiographic findings that accompany inborn errors of metabolism, one potentially under-recognized cause of enlarged ventricles. This case contributes to this small body of literature on the imaging features of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency by describing pre- and postnatal MR findings and key clinical details. Our report emphasizes the necessity of considering pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency and other metabolic disorders as potential etiologies for fetal ventriculomegaly since prompt diagnosis may allow for early initiation of treatment and improve outcome.},

There are nine reports of mediastinal teratoma, six of which were observed in patients with Klinefelter Syndrome. In another six cases, the paraneoplasic syndrome was attributed to intracranial tumoration, and two of these patients showed teratoma with areas of choriocarcinoma, whereas germinoma was suspected for clinical reasons in another three. Lastly, one case of presacral teratoma and one of retroperitoneal carcinoma were reported. The differential characteristics of paraneoplasic precocious puberty are: almost exclusive occurrence in males, because of tumoral production of HCG, moderate or absent increase of testicle size, hyperplasia of Leydig's cells without spermatogenesis, and rapidly progressive signs of puberty.},

Previous studies demonstrate that individuals diagnosed with Maffucci syndrome have approximately 100% lifetime risk of malignant transformation. Identification of Maffucci syndrome by surgical excision and pathological diagnosis can be life-saving due to its high malignant potential relative to other subtypes of enchondromatosis such as Ollier's disease. We report a case of a 58-year-old man with enchondromatosis who experienced malignant transformation of the enchondroma in his distal femur into a chondrosarcoma. He underwent a right distal femoral replacement without complications. Two years later, new masses were identified in his left hand and excised following progressive growth, pain, and functional limitation. Pathology confirmed these to be hemangiomas, and he was diagnosed with Maffucci syndrome. At last follow-up, patient reported additional nodular tumor growths occurring unilaterally on the left side. For patients with Maffucci syndrome, continual follow-up and careful surveillance of these masses is crucial as these lesions can cause fractures, deformities, pain, and undergo malignant transformation. Our report reviews the literature and outlines the treatment and management plans for patients with this rare and potentially dangerous disorder.},

The polypoid formation consisted of pseudostratified epithelium surrounding a central myxoid tissue which contained fibroblasts, histiocytes, and small inflammatory infiltrates. The most relevant features were histiocyte accumulations containing 1 to 5-microns diameter granules which displayed a concentric multilayered configuration. Ultrastructural findings revealed three types of lysosomes within the histiocyte cytoplasm: phagolysosomes, intermediate bodies, and Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Septate junctions between lysosomes were frequent. The etiopathogenesis of this lesion is discussed.},

Due to the numerous bacterial skin superinfections with Staphylococcus aureus, including abscesses that required surgical incision, the clinical picture was modified, leading to a delayed establishment of the diagnosis. Later, the symptoms became suggestive for this disease, the diagnostic having been confirmed by low plasma zinc values. Under zinc therapy, skin lesions improved significantly in a few days, with favorable outcome. Two months later, the skin lesions almost disappeared.Abscesses due to bacterial skin superinfections may lead to initially misdiagnosed acrodermatitis enteropathica.},

Left ventricular ejection fraction was 10 to 20% echocardiographically, and mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation were present.

A donor became available on July 25, 1991, and the transplantation was performed. Cardiac ischemic time was 97 min. Although she had transient OKT3 monoclonal antibody-related encephalopathy on her fifth postoperative day, she recovered normally. She had moderate rejection on the 20th postoperative day and mild rejection on the 79th and 149th postoperative days. She has had no significant infectious diseases. The baseline examination performed three months after heart transplantation revealed no abnormal findings on her coronary arteriogram. She returned to Japan and has been attending elementary school. The annual examination of her transplanted heart showed neither stenosis nor occlusion in her coronary angiogram. She has been receiving cyclosporine, azathioprine, and a low dose of prednisone as an immunosuppressive regimen.

Elevated plasma lactate and urinary 3-methylglutaconate led to a muscle biopsy which confirmed partial complex IV deficiency. PCR in leucocytes and muscle was negative for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. Faltering growth prompted an insulin tolerance test which confirmed growth hormone sufficiency and adrenal insufficiency. Plasma renin was elevated and adrenal androgens were low, suggesting primary adrenal insufficiency. Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy was initiated. A renal tubular Fanconi syndrome and diabetes mellitus developed subsequently. Sideroblastic anaemia and primary adrenal insufficiency, both individually and collectively, are associated with mtDNA deletion; however, absence of the same does not exclude the possibility that sideroblastic anaemia and primary adrenal insufficiency are of mitochondrial origin.},

To alleviate the right ventricular outflow obstruction, a palliative operation was planned, resecting the tumor and performing a right ventriculoplasty, which was cancelled due to the extent of infiltration of the tumor, and instead a right atrium to pulmonary artery shunt was attempted using a vascular prosthesis, only to fail due to an inability to maintain blood flow through the prosthesis.

    abstract = {Ictal laughter is the cardinal clinical sign of gelastic seizures in hypothalamic hamartomas and may also occur in extrahypothalamic epilepsies. Laughing consists of an affective and a motor component. It has been suggested that the affective component may result from an involvement of temporobasal structures, whereas the motor part is related to an involvement of the mesial frontal cortex. So far, evidence is based on a limited number of cases with spontaneously recorded seizures or in whom electrical stimulation of invasive intracranial EEG recordings has been performed. We report a patient who suffered from epigastric psychic auras, complex partial seizures with a gelastic component and secondarily generalized seizures. To evaluate a possible epileptogenic role of the hippocampus and dysplastic region in the right mid-temporal gyrus, intracranial monitoring with subdural electrodes over the temporobasal and temporolateral regions, as well as a deep brain electrode in the hippocampus, were performed. During the intial part of the seizure, consisting of an intense retrosternal ascending feeling with sexual connotation, rhythmic spikes in temporolateral contacts were detected. Concomitant with the development of smiling and laughter, a rhythmic activity over the temporobasal regions evolved. The patient became seizure-free following right temporal lobe resection. This case supports the assumption that ictal involvement of temporobasal structures is crucial for gelastic seizure components in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Progression to temporobasal regions was associated with the feeling of happiness whereas motor components of laughter occurred later. These findings are in accordance with the interpretation of surface recordings by Dericioglu and co-workers in a similar previous case. [Published with video sequences].},

The next day, the ketoacidosis disappeared, and she recovered consciousness. However, extensive ST-segment elevations in the electrocardiogram appeared with a positive troponin test, and the patient developed pulmonary edema on day 3. An echocardiogram showed globally reduced wall motion of the left ventricle and mild pericardial effusion. Despite medical therapy with intravenous furosemide, carperitide, and catecholamines, her cardiac function deteriorated rapidly, with the left ventricular ejection fraction decreasing to 26% within 7 hours, and progressed to cardiogenic shock that afternoon. The patient received mechanical circulatory support for 4 days with intra-aortic balloon pumping and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support, and recovered fully from circulatory failure. A paired serum antibody test showed a significantly elevated titer against parainfluenza-3 virus, indicating a diagnosis of fulminant viral myocarditis. She was discharged on multiple daily insulin injection therapy, and her subsequent clinical course has been uneventful. In summary, we present a case of concurrent FT1D and fulminant viral myocarditis. Parainfluenza-3 viral infection was confirmed serologically and was considered to be a cause of both the FT1D and fulminant myocarditis.},

An intracardiac biopsy of the right ventricle revealed disoriented myofibers, but myofiber degeneration improved, and no interstitial edema was present upon examination by light microscope. The electron microscopy showed that the intracellular edema had disappeared and other degenerative changes had also improved.

Since a small bowel lesion was suspected, peroral single-balloon enteroscopy was performed, which identified feces-like residue near the Billroth II anastomotic site and a connection to the colon separate from the afferent and efferent loops. Transanal single-balloon enteroscopy identified a fistula between the gastrojejunal anastomosis and transverse colon, with the scope reaching the stomach transanally. Barium enema confirmed flow of contrast medium from the transverse colon through the fistula to the anastomotic site, allowing the diagnosis of gastrojejunocolic fistula. Liver biopsy showed relatively severe steatohepatitis (Brunt's classification: stage 2-3, grade 3). Resection of the anastomotic site and partial transverse colectomy were performed to remove the fistula, followed by Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Postoperatively, watery diarrhea resolved and the stools became normal. Hepatopathy and hypoproteinemia improved. One year later, liver biopsy showed marked improvement of steatosis. This case demonstrated marked improvement of both diarrhea/nutritional status and steatohepatitis after treatment of gastrojejunocolic fistula, suggesting that the fistula caused non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.},

To clarify the nature of this phenomenon, we measured eye fixation patterns in a case of pure prosopagnosia (PS, Rossion et al., 2003) during her identification of photographs of personally familiar faces (27 children of her kindergarten). Her age-matched colleague served as a control. Consistent with previous evidence, the normal control identified the faces within two fixations located just below the eyes (central upper nose). This pattern (location and duration) of fixations remained unchanged even by increasing difficulty by presenting anti-caricatures of the faces. In contrast, the great majority of the patient's fixations, irrespective of her accuracy, were located on the mouth. Overall, these observations confirm the abnormally reduced processing of the upper area of the face in acquired prosopagnosia. Most importantly, the prosopagnosic patient also fixated the area of the eyes spontaneously in between the first and last fixation, ruling out alternative accounts of her behaviour such as, for example, avoidance or failure to orient attention to the eyes, as observed in autistic or bilateral amygdala patients. Rather, they reinforce our proposal of a high-level perceptual account (Caldara et al., 2005), according to which acquired prosopagnosic patients have lost the ability to represent multiple elements of an individual face as a perceptual unit (holistic face perception). To identify a given face, they focus very precisely on local features rather than seeing the whole of a face from its diagnostic centre (i.e., just below the eyes). The upper area of the face is particularly less attended to and less relevant for the prosopagnosic patient because it contains multiple features that require normal holistic perception in order to be the most diagnostic region. Consequently, prosopagnosic patients develop a more robust representation of the mouth, a relatively isolated feature in the face that may contain more information than any single element of the upper face area, and is thus sampled repeatedly for resolving ambiguity in the process of identification.},

Clinically, BP is characterised by generalised pruritic, bullous eruptions and urticaria-like lesions. Usually, BP is an idiopathic disorder; however, in some cases, underlying internal disorders are present, like diabetes or neurological disorders. Herein, we present a 33-year-old man with ESRD, maintained on haemodialysis, who developed BP. There are only six cases with BP provoked by the placement of a fistula for haemodialysis. BP in the current patient was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and indirect immunofluorescence using BIOCHIP. The patient responded promptly to tertracycline and 0·05% clobetasol propionate lesionally. However, the relationship between BP and the fistula for haemodialisys still remains unknown. It is highly likely that the skin injury associated with fistula placement was responsible for the alteration of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) and the stimulation of the immune system, leading to BP development. To explain the real role of fistula placement as a provocative factor in BP, other such cases are required for assessment.},

The interatrial septum was dilated with the use of an 8 mm balloon catheter to allow passage of larger balloon valvotomy catheters to the mitral anulus. The procedure resulted in a marked decrease in the diastolic transmitral gradient from 20 to 4 mm Hg. This decrease was associated with an increase in cardiac output from 3.4 to 5.7 liters/min. Mitral valve area increased from 0.7 to 2.5 cm2. Balloon valvotomy did not result in significant mitral regurgitation. This case indicates that further trials are warranted to evaluate percutaneous transseptal mitral valvotomy for the treatment of patients with mitral stenosis.},

We report the case of a 52-year old woman who initially presented to the gastroenterology department for extreme fatigue, pale stools, dark urine and pruritus. Laboratory tests showed significant cholestasis and elevation of aminotransferase levels. Immunological tests revealed positive antinuclear (ANA=1:320) and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA=1:40) with negative anti-smooth muscle and liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies. The biopsy was compatible with overlap syndrome type 1. The patient was commenced on immunosuppressive therapy according to standard of care (azathioprine 50mg, ursodeoxycholic acid and prednisone 0.5mg/kg), with moderate biochemical improvement. She subsequently developed proximal symmetrical weakness and cutaneous involvement and was diagnosed with biopsy-proven dermatomyositis. The immunosuppressive regimen was intensified to 150 mg azathioprine. At the three-month follow-up, her symptoms subsided and aminotransferases and muscle enzymes normalized. Upon further investigation the patient was diagnosed with autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first case of primary biliary cirrhosis - autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome associated with dermatomyositis, autoimmune thyroiditis and antiphospholipid syndrome.},

We experienced a case of adult hepatoblastoma in a 36-year-old female with chronic hepatitis B. She had experienced sudden onset abdominal pain. Her serum alpha-fetoprotein level was markedly elevated, and abdominal CT showed a 9-cm mass with internal hemorrhage in the right hepatic lobe with hemoperitoneum, so an emergency hepatic central bisectionectomy was performed. The initial histologic examination revealed that the mass mimicked combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with spindle-cell metaplasia of the cholangiocarcinoma element. Follow-up abdominal CT performed 3 months later showed a 5.5-cm metastatic mass in the left subphrenic area. Laparoscopic splenectomy with mass excision was performed, and hepatoblastoma was confirmed histologically. A histologic re-examination of previously obtained surgical specimens also confirmed the presence of hepatoblastoma. Metastatic hepatoblastoma was found at multiple sites of the abdomen during follow-up, and so chemotherapy with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and vincristine was applied, followed by carboplatin and doxorubicin. Despite surgery and postoperative chemotherapy, she died 12 months after symptom onset.},

The standard treatment for AIH includes corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprine. Although most patients achieve remission using the standard regimen, some patients do not respond due to either drug intolerance or refractory disease; in such cases alternative immunosuppressive agents should be explored. The second-line therapies are cyclophilin inhibitors such as cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, and nowadays mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is widely used if azathioprine-based therapies are not tolerated. Although these are recommended as an alternative to the first-line regimen, there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of second-line therapies, with the evidence based mainly on expert opinion. Therefore, we report an AIH patient receiving the standard regimen in whom remission did not occur due to side effects to azathioprine, but was successfully treated with MMF in combination with corticosteroids as an alternative to the standard regimen.},

Initial emergency room evaluation found the patient to have anisocoria with a fixed and dilated right pupil and demonstrated evidence of decorticate posturing. Imaging revealed a large right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, midline shift, and uncal herniation. Laboratory evaluation showed marked leukocytosis with blastic predominance and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Emergent surgical intervention was performed. However, despite evacuation of the hematoma, the patient eventually progressed to clinical brain death. Usually, ICH is seen in ALL patients after the diagnosis has been made. We report a unique case of fatal intracranial hemorrhage as the initial presentation of ALL and discuss the possible management dilemmas to treat such entities. ALL should be kept in the broad differential diagnosis of spontaneous ICH, especially in a young patient with evidence of severe coagulopathy.},

We identified two unrelated patients with defects in the Kennedy pathway due to biallellic loss-of-function mutations in phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1 alpha (PCYT1A), the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. The mutations lead to a marked reduction in PCYT1A expression and PC synthesis. The phenotypic consequences include some features, such as severe fatty liver and low HDL cholesterol levels, that are predicted by the results of previously reported liver-specific deletion of murine Pcyt1a. Both patients also had lipodystrophy, severe insulin resistance, and diabetes, providing evidence for an additional and essential role for PCYT1A-generated PC in the normal function of white adipose tissue and insulin action.},

However, despite clopidogrel treatment, some patients experience recurrent ischemic events. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 58-year-old man with polycythemia vera and concomitant thrombocytosis who suffered 6 episodes of cerebral infarctions and 1 myocardial infarction, despite treatment with clopidogrel. Following his last ischemic event, the antiplatelet therapy was intensified from initially clopidogrel monotherapy to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 75 mg once daily and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. Since then, no cardiovascular event has been reported. CONCLUSIONS This case report illustrates that insufficient platelet inhibition with clopidogrel monotherapy in a patient with thrombocytosis may be associated with recurrent arterial thrombosis. The exact reasons for the insufficient platelet inhibition are not known, but a plausible explanation may be an accelerated platelet turnover reflected by an increased number of immature platelets in this patient.},

    abstract = {Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a crucial health problem. With sudden death often being the first presentation, early diagnosis for ARVC is essential. Up to date, electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used diagnostic method without invasive harms. To diagnose and treat ARVC as well as possible, we should clearly elucidate its pathophysiological alterations. A 66-year-old farmer presented to the Emergency Department with continuous palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating, and nausea with no obvious predisposing causes. An ECG indicated ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion. After an immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and symptoms relieved. The patient was then transferred to the Department of Cardiology to receive ECG, echocardiography, coronary angiogram, biochemical assays, endocardiac tracing, and radiofrequency ablation. In the end, he was diagnosed with ARVC, evidenced by bilateral ventricle dilation and epsilon waves in leads V1-V3. Appropriate therapies were provided for this patient including pharmacological intervention and radiofrequency ablation. Although the diagnosis of ARVC is not difficult, this patient's ECG manifested several interesting features and should be further investigated: T wave inversions were found extensively in the anterior and inferior leads, revealing the involvement of bilateral ventricles; VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found, and some VTs manifested the feature of irregularly irregular rhythm, reminding us to carefully differentiate some special VTs from atrial fibrillation (AF); and epsilon waves gradually appeared in leads V1-V3 and avR since the onset of ARVC. Most importantly, the epsilon waves behind QRS complex appeared in both sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats/VT originating from cardiac apex, whereas the epsilon waves prior to QRS complex occurred in VT originating from right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The features of T wave inversion and epsilon wave in ECGs and the appearance of VTs with different morphologies can reflect the progression of ARVC. The position relationship between epsilon wave and QRS complex in VT depends on ventricular activation sequence, that is, the localization of epsilon wave depends on where VT is originating from.},

An MR angiogram documented also an aneurysm along the right intracranial vertebral artery at the junction with the posterior-inferior cerebellar artery. The aneurysm was successfully treated by means of endovascular coil embolization. No neurological complication occurred in our patient during the angiographic procedure. In this case, in addition to an incidental coexistence of CADASIL and large vessels abnormalities, a causal role of the Notch pathway alteration could be hypothesized. Dysregulation of the Notch pathway is linked to several human diseases besides CADASIL. In one of these (the Alagille syndrome) intracranial aneurysms are reported.

Yet, an atrial septal defect in the presence of congenital mitral stenosis may cause significant congestive heart failure in infancy. We present the case of an infant with Shone's syndrome, left ventricular hypoplasia, and a large ostium secundum atrial septal defect who developed pulmonary overcirculation following repair of coarctation of the aorta. The infant underwent cardiac catheterization, hemodynamic assessment, and successful percutaneous closure of the atrial septal defect. The patient improved dramatically following the intervention. Follow-up echocardiograms have demonstrated growth of mitral valve annulus diameter and left ventricular dimensions. Atrial septal defect closure in this small infant was associated with immediate improved clinical status, and improved growth of the left heart structures.},

He was treated with local radiation therapy to the esophagus and supraclavicular fossa, followed by combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, mitomycin C, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). After a modest initial response, disease progression was noted in the pulmonary nodules. He was then treated with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. After two cycles of this regimen, there was complete regression of his pulmonary nodules, which was sustained for 5 months. A review of 44 literature cases of esophageal adenoid cystic carcinoma contrasted with adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland origin indicated that the esophageal adenoid cystic carcinomas have a high tendency to metastasize (76% of cases) and a much poorer prognosis, with only 23% 1-year survival rate. It was concluded that esophageal adenoid carcinoma is clinopathologically distinct from the salivary gland variant, and that combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment modality for this cancer.},

Neurological examination revealed a moderate cognitive decline, with mild extrapyramidal symptoms, ataxia, and myoclonus. Brain T2-weighted MR imaging showed bilateral basal ganglia hypointensity with diffuse iron deposition. Increased serum ferritin, low serum copper concentration, undetectable ceruloplasmin, and normal urinary copper excretion were found. The genetic analysis of the CP (OMIM #604290) reported compound heterozygosity for two mutations, namely c.848G > A and c.2689_2690delCT. Treatment with FFP (500 mL i.v./once a week) and administration of iron chelator (Deferoxamine 1000 mg i.v/die for 5 days, followed by Deferiprone 500 mg/die per os) were undertaken. At the 6-month follow-up, clinical improvement of gait instability, trunk ataxia, and myoclonus was observed; brain MRI scan showed no further progression of basal ganglia T2 hypointensity. This case report suggests that the early initiation of combined treatment with FFP and iron chelation may be useful to reduce the accumulation of iron in the central nervous system and to improve the neurological symptoms.},

We present a singleton case of developmental regression and oxidative phosphorylation disorder in a 19-month-old girl. Subtle abnormalities in the serum creatine kinase level, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum bicarbonate led us to perform a muscle biopsy, which showed type I myofiber atrophy, increased lipid content, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. There were marked reductions in enzymatic activities for complex I and III. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity was near the 5% confidence level. To determine the frequency of routine laboratory abnormalities in similar patients, we performed a retrospective study including 159 patients with autism (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV and Childhood Autism Rating Scale) not previously diagnosed with metabolic disorders and 94 age-matched controls with other neurologic disorders. Aspartate aminotransferase was elevated in 38% of patients with autism compared with 15% of controls (P <.0001). The serum creatine kinase level also was abnormally elevated in 22 (47%) of 47 patients with autism. These data suggest that further metabolic evaluation is indicated in autistic patients and that defects of oxidative phosphorylation might be prevalent.},

A 45-year-old woman with menorrhagia and a complex pelvic mass underwent preoperative imaging and consequent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Histopathology revealed a 13-cm retroperitoneal, pedunculated leiomyoma arising from the uterus anterior to the internal cervical os. Literature review identified 105 cases of retroperitoneal leiomyomata from 1941 through 2007, with 37 cases, including our own, containing sufficient information for analysis. Abstracted variables included patient age, race, obstetric and gynecologic history, presentation and duration of symptoms, investigations, management, surgical findings, pathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics, duration of follow-up, evidence of recurrence and its management. Mean age (+/-SD) of the population was 46.27 +/- 13.19 years. More than 40% of patients had either undergone hysterectomy for uterine leiomyomata previously or had concurrent uterine leiomyomata. Of patients, 25% were asymptomatic, 31.3% experienced abdominal fullness, 18.8% had urinary symptoms, 18.8% had weight loss, and 18.8% had pelvic pain. Diagnostic evaluation was inconclusive and surgical excision was undertaken in all but 1 case. Median leiomyoma size was 12.0 cm (range 2.0-37.0 cm) with most in the posterior retroperitoneum, independent of the uterus. Pathologic and immunohistochemical investigations were comparable with those of uterine leiomyomata. Surgery was mostly curative with 5 reported cases of recurrence, 3 of which were then considered sarcomatous. Retroperitoneal leiomyomata present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, and as such require heightened surveillance.},

We report a new case of primary carnitine deficiency and offer direct evidence consistent with an impairment of carnitine uptake in differentiating muscle culture. The patient presented with severe and progressive cardiomyopathy and moderate proximal limb weakness. Plasma and muscle carnitine levels were very low, and the maximal rate of carnitine transport in cultured fibroblasts was deficient. An asymptomatic sister with intermediate levels of carnitine in plasma showed partially deficient carnitine uptake in fibroblasts, indicating heterozygosity. The patient's condition improved dramatically with oral carnitine therapy. Further studies were performed in cultured muscle cells at different stages of maturation, which demonstrated deficient maximal rates of carnitine uptake. Our findings are consistent with the concept that primary carnitine deficiency is the result of a generalized defect involving carnitine transport across tissue membranes.},

The Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) mode was used to improve adaptation to mechanical ventilation after Vertical Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Ribs (VEPTRs) were implanted. The synchrony achieved with the NAVA mode allowed a decrease of the sedoanalgesia he received. A follow-up CT scan showed a reduction in the volume of the posterobasal atelectasis. The evolution of this patient suggests that the combined use of VEPTR for thoracic expansion and ventilation using NAVA can favour the global improvement.

The initial serum potassium was >13 mmol litre(-1) and prolonged CPR was required while potassium levels were reduced. Further investigation demonstrated a creatine kinase (CK) >70 000 U litre(-1) which was consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Despite requiring CPR for 1 h 45 min and a prolonged intensive care admission for multi-organ failure, the child has made an excellent recovery, including normal cognitive function. Subsequent genetic analysis has shown that the boy has previously undiagnosed Becker's muscular dystrophy. We believe that the patient had acute rhabdomyolysis as a result of a volatile anaesthetic agent in association with an undiagnosed muscular dystrophy. In recent years, largely based on case report literature, there has been a shift in opinion as to the cause of such adverse perioperative events. What was previously thought to be malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) is now considered to be anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis, an alternative and distinct reaction. The distinguishing feature of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis from MH is an acute rhabdomyolysis, without preceding hypermetabolism.},

PDHc deficiency is one of the commoner metabolic disorders of lactic acidosis presenting with neurological phenotypes that vary with age and gender. In this mini-review, we postulate mechanisms of epilepsy in the setting of PDHc deficiency using two illustrative cases (one with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1-alpha polypeptide (PDHA1) deficiency and the second one with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E1-beta subunit (PDHB) deficiency (a rare subtype of PDHc deficiency)) and a selected review of published case series. PDHc plays a critical role in the pathway of carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. In severe deficiency states the resulting energy deficit impacts on brain development in utero resulting in structural brain anomalies and epilepsy. Milder deficiency states present with variable manifestations that include cognitive delay, ataxia, and seizures. Epileptogenesis in PDHc deficiency is linked to energy failure, development of structural brain anomalies and abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism. The use of the ketogenic diet bypasses the metabolic block, by providing a direct source of acetyl-CoA, leading to amelioration of some symptoms. Genetic counseling is essential as PDHA1 deficiency (commonest defect) is X-linked although females can be affected due to unfavorable lyonization, while PDHB and PDH phosphatase (PDP) deficiencies (much rarer defects) are of autosomal recessive inheritance. Research is in progress for looking into animal models to better understand pathogenesis and management of this challenging disorder.},

This report describes a 38-year-old woman who initially presented with a variety of symptoms including headaches, light sensitivity, nausea and vomiting, acute visual changes, cold intolerance, amenorrhea, decreased libido, fatigue and galactorrhea. She had an elevated serum prolactin level and evidence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. Imaging studies discovered a 1.8cm mass involving the pituitary gland and compressing the optic chiasm. The lesion was excised and microscopically was marked by a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and scattered nonnecrotizing granulomas. Stains and microbiologic cultures failed to demonstrate microorganisms. There was no evidence of other organ involvement on postoperative imaging. She was treated with prednisone with improvement of symptoms and subsequently required methotrexate to treat left eye pain and blurred vision, 29months after her surgery. Achieving treatment control in patients with pituitary and hypothalamic improvement in sarcoidosis still remains a challenge.},

After extensive cardiopulmonary investigations, he was diagnosed with severe HPS as a result of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) leading to cirrhosis. He subsequently underwent successful hepatic transplantation and continues to improve at 12-month follow-up.

In this work, we analyzed lesions in different organs of four dengue fatal cases, occurred in Brazil. Tissues were prepared for visualization in optical and electron microscopy, with damages quantification. As expected, we observed in all studied organ lesions characteristic of severe dengue, such as hemorrhage and edema, although other injuries were also detected. Cases presented necrotic areas in the liver and diffuse macro and microsteatosis, which were more accentuated in case 1, who also had obesity. The lung was the most affected organ, with hyaline membrane formation associated with mononuclear infiltrates in patients with pre-existing diseases such as diabetes and obesity (cases 1 and 2, respectively). These cases had also extensive acute tubular necrosis in the kidney. Infection induced destruction of cardiac fibers in most cases, with absence of nucleus and loss of striations, suggesting myocarditis. Spleens revealed significant destruction of the germinal centers and atrophy of lymphoid follicles, which may be associated to decrease of T cell number. Circulatory disturbs were reinforced by the presence of megakaryocytes in alveolar spaces, thrombus formation in glomerular capillaries and loss of endothelium in several tissues. Besides histopathological and ultrastructural observations, virus replication were investigated by detection of dengue antigens, especially the non-structural 3 protein (NS3), and confirmed by the presence of virus RNA negative strand (in situ hybridization), with second staining for identification of some cells. Results showed that dengue had broader tropism comparing to what was described before in literature, replicating in hepatocytes, type II pneumocytes and cardiac fibers, as well as in resident and circulating monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells.},

However, many questions remain such as whether or not long-term treatment is necessary in some patients and what are the risks of prolonged therapy. CASE REPORT Here, we discuss the case of a 37-year-old woman with CFH and CD46 genetic abnormalities who developed aHUS with severe renal failure. She was successfully treated with three doses of rituximab and a three month treatment with eculizumab. After eculizumab withdrawal, symptoms of thrombotic micro-angiopathy (TMA) recurred, therefore eculizumab treatment was restarted. The patient exhibited normal renal function and no symptoms of aHUS at one-year follow-up with further eculizumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the clinical challenges of the diagnosis and management of patient with aHUS with complement-mediated TMA involvement. Attention was paid to the consequences of the treatment withdrawal. Exact information regarding genetic abnormalities and renal function associated with aHUS, as well as estimations of the relapse risk and monitoring of complement tests may provide insights into the efficacy of aHUS treatment, which will enable the prediction of therapeutic responses and testing of new treatment options. Improvements in our understanding of aHUS and its causes may facilitate the identification of patients in whom anti-complement therapies can be withdrawn without risk.},

From a pathogenetic point of view, the mechanism responsible for occurrence of symptomatology relies on the aggregation of platelets within the ulcer cavity, activation of coagulation mechanism, formation of thrombus and arterio-arterial embolization of thrombotic material in the central nervous system. Many imaging modalities including unenhanced ultrasound, computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography have been used to image and diagnose carotid plaque ulceration with varying success. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound has been recently introduced in the study of carotid disease offering improved flow visualization and better plaque surface delineation. We present a case where contrast-enhanced ultrasound visualized the swirling pattern of movement of the microbubbles within the ulcer cavity. These findings illustrate the underlying hemodynamic mechanism of arterio-arterial embolization and can be proposed as a new finding of plaque ulcerations on contrast-enhanced ultrasound.},

Spinal involvement in ochronosis produces loss of flexibility and ankylosis of thoracic and lumbar segments. Pseudarthrosis is a serious complication of the diseases that present with ankylosis of the spine. However, its occurrence in ochronotic spine has not been reported previously. Evaluation of progressive paraparesis in a 68-year-old man with ochronosis revealed pseudarthrosis at the T11-12 level. Circumferential dural sac decompression, debridement of the disc space, interbody fusion, and screw-rod fixation were all done via a posterior-only approach. Postoperatively the patient exhibited a marked recovery in terms of pain and neurological status. At the 3-month follow-up, he was able to walk independently. Ochronosis should be included in the etiology of pseudarthrosis. With aggravation of back pain and the appearance of neurological deficits in an already stable patient with any ankylosing disease, pseudarthrosis should be suspected. Furthermore, single-stage, 360°, posterior-only surgery may obviate the need for single-stage or staged anterior-posterior surgical intervention in patients with pseudarthrosis of the thoracic and lumbar spine.},

Computed tomography-based navigation has the problem of change in intersegmental anatomy after positioning for surgery. Iso-C-based computer navigation acquires the intraoperative real-time images after patient positioning and thus avoids registration errors and improves accuracy. A Hangman fracture treated by posterior direct pedicle screw fixation using Iso-C computer navigation guidance is reported. Postoperative computed tomographic images confirmed the accurate placement of pedicular screws. Intraoperative fluoroscopy-based computer navigation is advantageous especially in an unstable upper cervical spine injury where the likelihood of change in the intersegmental relationship is maximal before and after positioning for surgery. The Iso-C navigation has the advantages of clarity and accuracy, making safe pedicle fixation of C1 and C2 possible despite fractured posterior elements. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of displaced Hangman fracture treated successfully using Iso-C fluoroscopic navigation assisted direct pedicle screw osteosynthesis in the literature. Intraoperative acquisition of fluoroscopic images avoids registration-related problems. Three-dimensional fluoroscopic navigation gives excellent accuracy and safety in screw instrumentation of Hangman fracture.},

He was transferred to our institution for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) given his refractory hypoxaemia. On arrival, H1N1 influenza virus was confirmed and all measures to improve oxygenation were ineffective. Thus, the decision was made to start venovenous (VV)-ECMO. Although a low baseline platelet count was recognised (60-70×109/L), a sudden further decrease occurred (30×109/L) and platelet transfusion was initiated. A substantial increase in the pressure across the ECMO oxygenator was identified, and the diagnosis of type II heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected and confirmed. Heparin was discontinued, the oxygenator was exchanged and argatroban was used for anticoagulation. After 28 days on VV-ECMO support, the decision was made to withdraw organ support in conjunction with the patient and family wishes.},

The presence of such a mutation should be confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Our patient expands the neurological features of FRDA to include sleep apnea.

Based on a review of existing literature, it was evident that the spine is an uncommon location to find melorheostosis, making this disease entity a unique cause of myelopathy. The patient's progress was closely observed during his inpatient rehabilitation program, after he underwent spinal decompression surgery. Starting from the level of complete paralysis, he was able to regain functional strength in his legs by the end of his 2-month course. Despite the lack of reported outcomes in cases of myelopathy associated with melorheostosis, our report describes a favorable prognosis with good recovery of both strength and function.},

We experienced a 32-year old man who presented with dyspnea, palpitations and very frequent VPCs (31% of the total heart beats). Echocardiography revealed a dilated left ventricle (LV 66 mm at end-diastole and 57 mm at end-systole) and a decreased ejection fraction (34%). Very frequent VPCs had been detected 10 years previously and he underwent a failed radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) procedure at that time. The patient had been treated with heart failure medications including betablockers, ACE inhibitors and spironolactone for the two most recent years. Six months after we eliminated these VPCs with a second RFCA procedure, the heart returned to normal function and size. Long standing and very frequent VPCs could be the cause of left ventricular dysfunction in a subset of patients who suffer with dilated cardiomyopathy, and RFCA should be the choice of therapy for these patients.},

The causal pathway often involves a concatenation of factors or events, some of which can be prevented or controlled. Effective interventions can operate before, during, or after a crash occurs at the levels of driver capacity, vehicle and road design, and public policy. A variety of systemic, neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders put drivers at potential increased risk of a car crash in the short or long term. Medical diagnosis and age alone are usually insufficient criteria for determining fitness to drive. Strategies are needed for determining what types and levels of reduced function provide a threshold for disqualification in drivers with medical disorders. Evidence of decreased mileage, self-restriction to driving in certain situations, collisions, moving violations, aggressive driving, sleepiness, alcohol abuse, metabolic disorders, and multiple medications may trigger considerations of driver safety. A general framework for evaluating driver fitness relies on a functional evaluation of multiple domains (cognitive, motor, perceptual, and psychiatric) that are important for safe driving and can be applied across many disorders, including conditions that have rarely been studied with respect to driving, and in patients with multiple conditions and medications. Neurocognitive tests, driving simulation, and road tests provide complementary sources of evidence to evaluate driver safety. No single test is sufficient to determine who should drive and who should not.},

    abstract = {A child presented in early childhood with episodes of coma and hypoglycemia and a rapidly evolutive myopathy and cardiomyopathy leading to death at 9 mo of age. Ketosis was decreased (blood beta-hydroxybutyrate: 0.07 mmol/L) despite normal plasma levels of fatty acids (0.81 mmol/L). The patient's urine contained excessive amounts of the C6 to C10 dicarboxylic acids present in almost all defects of fatty acid mitochondrial oxidation. More specifically, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified an accumulation of medium- and long-chain (C8 to C14) 3-hydroxy-dicarboxylic acids, suggesting a defect of the mitochondrial enzyme that normally dehydrogenates these 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA esters. Biochemical studies in the patient's cultured fibroblasts confirmed the impairment of medium- and long-chain fatty acid oxidation, and allowed the recognition of the deficiency of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The activities of long-, medium-, and short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase were normal. These results describe a disorder of fatty acid metabolism that affects the liver, skeletal muscles, and myocardium. It is important to point out that long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA deficiency shares many clinical similarities with systemic carnitine deficiency, as well as with carnitine-palmityl-CoA transferase and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies. The differential diagnosis of this disease relies on the demonstration of long-chain urinary dicarboxylic acids with a hydroxyl group in 3-position and the study of the enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts.},

These receptors include cytoplasmic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) whose stimulation recruits and proteolytically activates caspase-1 within the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex. Caspase-1 mediates the production of interleukin-1 family cytokines (IL1FCs), leading to fever and inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). Mutations that constitutively activate these pathways underlie several autoinflammatory diseases with diverse clinical features. We describe a family with a previously unreported syndrome featuring neonatal-onset enterocolitis, periodic fever, and fatal or near-fatal episodes of autoinflammation. We show that the disease is caused by a de novo gain-of-function mutation in NLRC4 encoding a p.Val341Ala substitution in the HD1 domain of the protein that cosegregates with disease. Mutant NLRC4 causes constitutive IL1FC production and macrophage cell death. Infected macrophages from affected individuals are polarized toward pyroptosis and exhibit abnormal staining for inflammasome components. These findings identify and describe the cause of a life-threatening but treatable autoinflammatory disease that underscores the divergent roles of the NLRC4 inflammasome.},

Both strains belong to the sequence type (ST) 8 community-associated genetic lineage that carries the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type IVa and the S. aureus protein A gene (spa) type t292 and are phylogenetically related to MRSA lineage USA300. A conjugative plasmid of 55,706 bp (pBRZ01) carrying the vanA cluster was identified and readily transferred to other staphylococci. The pBRZ01 plasmid harbors DNA sequences that are typical of the plasmid-associated replication genes rep24 or rep21 described in community-associated MRSA strains from Australia (pWBG745). The presence and dissemination of community-associated MRSA containing vanA could become a serious public health concern.},

Blau syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disease and is known to be caused by mutations in the CARD15 gene (also called NOD2). We investigated the hypothesis that an individual with sporadic early onset granulomatous arthritis may have a Blau syndrome mutation in CARD15/NOD2. Our patient's genomic DNA isolated from a buccal swab sample was subjected to amplification to include the region of exon 4 from the CARD15/NOD2 gene that contains known mutations that cause Blau syndrome. This region was screened for mutations by direct DNA sequencing in both directions. One of the mutations in CARD15/NOD2 attributed to Blau syndrome was found in the DNA sample. The nucleotide change encodes an amino acid substitution from arginine to tryptophan at position 334 of the protein. This mutation has been found in some Blau syndrome pedigrees reported in the literature. These data suggest that sporadic granulomatous arthritis may in fact be the sporadic form of Blau syndrome, but arising from a spontaneous neomutation. This would explain the profound clinical identity and the lack of disease history in the parents.},

The fundus flavimaculatus with macular dystrophy (FFM), an autosomal recessive condition responsible for gradual loss of visual acuity in adulthood (second to third decade) has also been mapped to the same locus. However, a gene for autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa with distinctive features of choriocapillaris atrophy at an advanced stage (RP19) has been mapped to the genetic interval encompassing the STGD gene on chromosome 1p (D1S435-D1S236), raising the question of whether, despite striking differences in clinical course and presentation, RP19 and STGD might be allelic disorders at the ABCR locus. In a family segregating RP and STGD in two first cousins, we found that heterozygosity for a splicing mutation in the ABCR gene (1938-1 G-->A) resulted in STGD while hemizygosity for this splice mutation resulted in RP, and when studying the RP patient's parents, we found a maternal non-contribution with apparent segregation of a null allele ascribed to a partial deletion of the ABCR gene. The present study shows that, despite striking clinical differences, RP19 and STGD are allelic disorders at the ABCR locus.},

A life-threatening complication of laryngeal sarcoidosis is upper airway obstruction. In this report we describe our experience in the acute and chronic care of a patient who required an emergent tracheostomy, with the aim to provide further insight into this difficult to manage disease. CASE REPORT A 37-year-old African American female with a 10-year history of stage 1 sarcoidosis presented with severe dyspnea. Laryngeal sarcoidosis was diagnosed three years previously, and she remained stable on low-dose prednisone until six months prior to admission, at which time she self-discontinued her prednisone for the homeopathic treatment Nopalea cactus juice. Her physical examination was concerning for impending respiratory failure as she presented with inspiratory stridor and hoarseness. Laryngoscopy showed a retroflexed epiglottis obstructing the glottis with edematous arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds. Otolaryngology performed an emergent tracheostomy to secure her airway and obtained epiglottic biopsies, which were consistent with sarcoidosis. She was eventually discharged home on prednisone 60 mg daily. Following months of corticosteroids, a laryngoscopy showed the epiglottis continuing to obstruct the glottis. The addition of methotrexate to a tapered dosage of prednisone 10 mg daily was unsuccessful, and she remains on prednisone 20 mg daily for disease control. CONCLUSIONS Laryngeal sarcoidosis, a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of sarcoidosis, uncommonly presents as the life-threatening complication of complete upper airway obstruction. As such, laryngeal sarcoidosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, requiring a high index of suspicion for timely diagnosis and treatment.},

It belongs to the group of CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases with its underlying molecular genetical defect on chromosome 3p12-p21.1. Here, we performed a systematic study of the neuropathology on unconventional thick serial sections of the first available brain tissue of a genetically confirmed late-onset SCA7 patient with a very short CAG-repeat expansion. Along with myelin pallor of a variety of central nervous fiber tracts, we observed i) neurodegeneration in select areas of the cerebral cortex, and ii) widespread nerve cell loss in the cerebellum, thalamus, nuclei of the basal ganglia, and brainstem. In addition, upon immunocytochemical analysis using the anti-polyglutamine antibody 1C2, immunopositive neuronal intranuclear inclusions bodies (NI) were observed in all cerebellar regions, in all parts of the cerebral cortex, and in telencephalic and brainstem nuclei, irrespective of whether they underwent neurodegeneration. These novel findings provide explanations for a variety of clinical symptoms and paraclinical findings of both our and other SCA7 patients. Finally, our immunocytochemical analysis confirms previous studies which described the presence of NI in obviously degenerated brain and retinal regions as well as in apparently well-preserved brain regions and retina of SCA7 patients.},

Goldenhar in 1952. Its treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. Herein, we describe the value of 3D-CT evaluation in a patient with Goldenhar syndrome, with particular regard to planning diagnostic and therapeutic approach. A 7-year-old boy with Goldenhar syndrome with definite post-natal genetic diagnosis was referred to our Department of Radiology for neuroimaging of the temporal bone. By 3D-CT evaluation of this young patient we observed the asymmetry of the condyles with the right one dysmorphic, short and wide; the auricle of the right ear was replaced by a dysmorphic rough; the right middle ear had a hypoplastic tympanic cavity and the internal auditory canal of right ear was atresic. In our experience, 3D-CT is a powerful diagnostic instrument and offers many advantages: volumetric reproduction of cranium and soft tissues, no overlap of anatomic parts that limits the visibility of various structures, high precision and assurance of images, and a constant and easily reproducible reference system. In our case, 3D-CT offered a very complete evaluation of all malformations of mandibular and temporal bone that characterize this syndrome and representing an important step for ENT and orthodontic therapeutic approaches.},

A 51-year-old woman with gastric cancer died of subacute respiratory failure. Autopsy showed gastric signet ring cell carcinoma with diffuse metastasis of pulmonary lymphatics and pleurae; every organ examined lacked a space-occupying tumor mass. Histologically, proliferated intimal myofibroblasts obliterated most of the pulmonary vascular lumen, and a few stenosed vascular lumina contained cancer cells. In addition, pulmonary vasculature associated with intimal proliferation contained microthrombi. Most cancer cells in the stomach and pulmonary lymphatics were typical signet ring cells, whereas those in vascular lesions were cells of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma without mucous production. Consistent with a previous report, the latter expressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tissue factor (TF). The proliferated intimal myofibroblasts also expressed type 2A serotonin receptor (5-HT(2A)). These findings suggest that local expression of VEGF, TF, and 5-HT(2A) may be linked to the pathogenesis of this unusual pulmonary complication.},

During repeated operation, this lesion was shown to be a synovial sarcoma, which had invaded the dura mater. The tumor metastasized to the mediastinum and the intradural cervical spine and, finally, to the brain and the lungs.

Three months after the initial biopsy, the patient continued to have hypocomplementemia and nephrotic syndrome, prompting a repeated kidney biopsy that showed findings most consistent with C3 glomerulopathy. C3 glomerulopathy is a proliferative pattern of glomerulonephritis characterized by complement deposits that stain solely or dominantly for C3.

We describe four unrelated T8993C patients who had diverse, relatively mild, clinical manifestations. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymphorphism analysis showed that the heteroplasmic T8993C point mutation was very abundant in several tissues from all four patients (94.2 +/- 1.5%) but was less copious in blood from 20 maternal relatives. ATP production in mitochondria isolated from skin fibroblasts in three patients was normal, whereas in one patient it was decreased to 20-35% of controls.

A surgically resected specimen revealed that the tumor was comprised of three different components: HGA and solid-type ACC in the central portion and lower-grade ACC in the periphery. The tumor was discriminated from a dedifferentiated carcinoma or hybrid tumor. Autopsy specimens also demonstrated both solid-type ACC and HGA components in the lung and spleen. Immunohistochemically, positive staining of p53 protein was detected on both solid-type ACC and HGA cells, but cyclin D1 and HER2/neu was only seen in HGA cells. Solid-type ACC cells were immunoreactive for CD117 (c-kit), but lower-grade ACC and HGA cells were negative. This case suggests that the overexpression of CD117, p53 protein, cyclin D1, and HER2/neu might be involved in the progression from lower-grade ACC to solid-type ACC and HGA.},

Subsequent scans confirmed the diagnosis of a sirenomelia sequence with the fusion of the lower extremities without fusion of the bones according to Stocker I classification. The size of the intraabdominal cyst decreased during follow-up. After counseling, termination of pregnancy was induced. The postmortem X-ray confirmed the ultrasound diagnosis. The exact etiological mechanism of this malformation is still unknown. An early alteration of the embryological vascular network damaging the caudal mesoderm is thought to lead to arrested development of the lower limbs and other affected organs. The cyst we saw in the 9th week might fit with this theory, either as an expression of the complex malformation of the lower abdomen or as the sonographic appearance of necrosis.},

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II and palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activities were increased, whereas carnitine acetyltransferase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (FAD) and succinate dehydrogenase were decreased. Investigation of blood and skeletal muscle of the family members revealed marked abnormalities in a 7-year old sister who had only minor neurological symptoms. Histochemical investigation revealed abnormal accumulations of lipid between the myofibrils. Carnitine was decreased in her skeletal muscle and blood.

The activities of succinate dehydrogenase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) were normal.

The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation has reported 336 simultaneous heart and kidney transplantations with a 70% rate of 5 year survival. Herein we have presented the first case of simultaneous heart plus kidney transplantation in Chile. The patient is a 62-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension who in 1997 had a myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure. He underwent a coronary bypass but developed progressive heart failure, with an ejection fraction less than 20% and moderate mitral regurgitation. He required chronic hemodialysis and survived a cardiac arrest, receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Transplantation was performed in 2004 in 2 phases: initially a heart, followed by a kidney transplantation. Immunosuppression included Daclizumab, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids. He developed acute renal failure but did not receive dialysis. He left the hospital at 25 days posttransplantation. Two years following double transplantation, he has not shown acute rejection episodes of either the cardiac or the kidney graft. Both cardiac and renal functions are normal. In conclusion, simultaneous heart plus kidney transplantations offer a good alternative treatment for patients with advanced disease of both organs.},

Endobronchial and endotracheal metastases from extra-pulmonary solid tumors are rare.Patients and methods:We reported the case of a patient diagnosed with endobronchial and endotracheal metastases from rectal adenocarcinoma.Case report:Patient P.G., 62 years old, was diagnosed with a rectal tumor in 2011, for which, a surgical intervention was performed (pT3 pN2a M0, stage IIIB). Afterwards, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and concomitant radiochemotherapy. In September 2013, the chest CT showed 2 nodules for which, an incomplete surgical resection was done and which were histopathologically diagnosed as metastases from rectal cancer. The patient continued the treatment with chemotherapy associated with Bevacizumab and after 6 months only Bevacizumab for maintenance. In June 2015, the chest CT pointed out a nodule in the right upper lobe and the bronchoscopy highlighted a 4-5 mm lesion at the level of the right primary bronchus, whose biopsy proved the rectal origin. Afterwards, another surgical intervention was performed. Unfortunately, the postoperative chest CT revealed an intratracheal tissue mass (11/ 7mm) and multiple metastases in the right lung. The bronchoscopy showed 2 endotracheal lesions, out of which one was biopsied (histopathological result of metastasis from rectal cancer). Despite the fact that chemotherapy was continued, other endobronchial lesions appeared. All of them were removed and the patient started radiotherapy on the tracheal area. Afterwards, she refused to continue chemotherapy. The last bronchoscopy highlighted one endobronchial and two endotracheal secondary malignant lesions.Conclusion:Endobronchial and endotracheal metastases must be taken into consideration in all the patients with a history of extra-pulmonary cancer.Abbreviations:CT = computed tomography, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, IMRT = intensity-modulated radiotherapy, ESMO = European Society for Medical Oncology, NCCN = National Comprehensive Cancer Network, iv = intravenous, PET - CT = Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography.},

    abstract = {Pulmonary hypertension (PH), defined as elevated pulmonary artery pressure, is common in the general population and associated with increased mortality. Accordingly, physicians commonly encounter patients with dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and/or right heart failure who have elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) on echocardiography. Although pulmonary arterial vasodilators may often be considered in this setting, these drugs have been predominantly tested in the subset of PH patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Elevated PASP alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis of PAH, and secondary causes of PASP elevation, most commonly left heart disease, are far more prevalent than isolated PAH. Treatment of this more common group of patients with PH due to left heart disease is challenging because there are few evidence-based treatment options, and pulmonary vasodilator therapy may lead to worsening symptoms. Therefore, improving symptoms and avoiding adverse outcomes in patients with PH requires the following: (1) understanding the optimal use of echocardiography for the diagnosis of PH; (2) recognizing the utility and proper interpretation of invasive hemodynamic testing prior to starting pulmonary vasodilator therapy; (3) differentiating PAH from pulmonary venous hypertension due to left heart disease; and (4) understanding the appropriate treatment strategies for PH and resultant right heart failure.},

    abstract = {In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).},

Investigations showed markedly elevated androstenedione and 17 hydroxyprogesterone misdirecting to possible late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. High serum testosterone and oestrogens with suppressed gonadotrophins, however, indicated an androgen-secreting tumour. A normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and elevated inhibins A and B indicated the tumour was ovarian in origin, which was confirmed on pelvic examination and imaging. At laparotomy, a right ovarian sertoliform endometrioid carcinoma was removed, following which the patient developed menopausal vasomotor symptoms and improvement of her virilism. Serum testosterone, oestradiol, inhibins A and B became undetectable, gonadotrophins appropriately increased and 17 hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione normalized. We propose that inhibins may be of diagnostic value and should be included in investigative algorithms of females with virilization and hyperandrogenaemia, especially if postmenopausal. Androgen-secreting tumours must be excluded before raised 17 hydroxyprogesterone concentrations are used to diagnose late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia in females with new-onset virilization.},

During an oesophagectomy, the azygos vein typically is transected as a requirement of the surgery. In this case, the enlarged azygos and its arch were a continuation of the IVC. During our procedure, we first established a bypass between the right femoral vein and the jugular vein in case of injury to the azygos vein, and we then performed a McKeown oesophagectomy without transecting the azygos vein. Our experience suggests that an oesophagectomy in cases with an azygos vein continuation of the IVC is feasible. An adequate medical examination and careful reading of the imaging is crucial for the safety of these surgical procedures. An appropriate surgical approach should be selected according to the location of the tumour, the size of the tumour and its anatomical features. The establishment of a veno-venous bypass and protection of the azygos arch in patients whose azygos vein is a continuation of IVC is necessary.},

However, whether or not myocardial fibrosis is a common cause of systemic RV failure in patients with ccTGA remains unclear. Here, we describe an 82-year-old man who had been diagnosed previously as having uncomplicated ccTGA and situs inversus and recently developed systemic RV failure, which was neither associated with severe TR nor advanced conduction tissue abnormalities. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) with delayed-enhancement imaging clearly detected extensive myocardial scars (presumably fibrosis) in the RV wall as well as prominent dilatation, hypertrophy, and systolic dysfunction of the systemic RV. These findings suggest that myocardial fibrosis can cause systemic RV failure in elderly patients with uncomplicated ccTGA despite the absence of severe TR or advanced conduction tissue abnormalities and that CMR may be a useful examination to accurately detect systemic RV failure associated with myocardial fibrosis and to subsequently clarify the prognosis in these patients.},

A diagnosis of primary amyloidosis was made on the basis of a heavy deposition of amyloid in the gastric submucosal tissue in addition to the hematological and immunological findings. Intermittent chemotherapy in combination with daily oral dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) resulted in a dramatic decrease of plasma cells in the marrow as well as a gradual improvement of CHF. With this therapy, the cardiac ejection fraction was markedly improved. This case indicates that the long-standing administration of DMSO combined with cytoreductive chemotherapy is therefore effective in treating some cases with primary amyloidosis.},

In the 29th week of pregnancy, she developed embolic symptom in her left lower limb. A cardiac murmur was detected, and a significant regurgitation of the mitral valve, along with a mobile vegetation at the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, was detected by cardiac ultrasound examination, thus resulting in a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. At the time of diagnosis, the fetus was estimated to weigh 1400 g, and it was delivered by cesarian section, with a mitral valve repair being performed 4 days later. The mother did well and was discharged from the hospital after remission on the 30th hospital day. The infant was admitted to the NICU and was discharged from the hospital with good development and no complications at the age of 59 days, weighing 3066 g. Cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation in pregnant women is rare, and it is believed to have a high mortality rate for both the mothers and fetuses. On the other hand, the survival rate of low birth weight infants has improved as a consequence of progress in neonatal care. We herein report a case of mitral valve repair in the second trimester with a good outcome for both the mother and the infant.},

The patient was a 29-year-old man who experienced recurrent episodes of palpitation and syncope after drinking alcohol. Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevation in precordial leads V1-3 without Q-Tc prolongation. Organic heart disease and coronary artery disease were excluded by noninvasive and invasive tests. Ventricular fibrillation was induced by the application of a single extra-stimulus to the right ventricular outflow tract. During isoproterenol infusion, SMVT of left bundle branch block morphology (240/min) was induced by the application of a single extrastimulus to the right ventricular apex. SMVT also developed spontaneously. Pace mapping disclosed that SMVT originated at the free wall of the right ventricular outflow tract. Head-up tilt test and an alcohol provocation test both induced similar SMVT that was associated with hypotension and near syncope. SMVT was not terminated by intravenous administration of lidocaine, procainamide or adenosine triphosphate (10 mg), but was terminated by propranolol. Thus, a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism appears to play an important role in SMVT in this patient. The site of origin of SMVT might be closely related to the lesion that causes ST-segment elevation.},

The use of eculizumab in these settings has been previously described, but its role still remains to be clarified. A 45-year-old man, with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and subsequent end-stage kidney failure, presented for a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant. Immunologically, he was well matched with the donor, and he received standard induction immunosuppression including tacrolimus. His early transplant course was complicated by Haemophilus parainfluenzae paronychia and a Pseudomonas aeruginosa catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Within 1 week, he developed thrombotic microangiopathy with significant renal dysfunction and eventual dialysis dependence, without evidence of transplant rejection on biopsy. He was also noted to have antiphospholipid antibodies in moderate titres. The TMA did not resolve despite cessation of tacrolimus, and he was subsequently commenced on eculizumab. The patient achieved a partial remission from TMA, with ongoing biochemical evidence of haemolysis, although now with stable graft function, despite significant damage. His transplanted pancreas remained seemingly unaffected by TMA, and continues to function well. This case describes an unusual presentation of TMA post-transplantation and is the only described case of eculizumab use following pancreas-kidney transplant. It remains unclear in this case what the likely precipitant for TMA was, although it seems to be, at least in part, controlled by ongoing use of eculizumab, presumably by terminal complement inhibition.},

It can cause delayed neurologic symptoms similar to those seen in Lyme disease (LD) patients. Thymus derived T-cells (myelin reactive) migrate to the blood brain barrier and stimulate an inflammatory cascade in the central nervous system. Cell based therapies play an important role in treating neurological diseases such as MS and LD. CASE REPORT Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) therapy was used to treat two patients with both MS and LD. The hESCs were administered via different routes including intramuscular, intravenous, and supplemental routes (e.g., deep spinal, caudal, intercostal through eye drops) to regenerate the injured cells. Both the patients showed remarkable improvement in their functional skills, overall stamina, cognitive abilities, and muscle strength. Furthermore, the improvement in the patients' conditions were assessed by magnetic resonance tractography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). CONCLUSIONS Therapy with hESCs might emerge as an effective and safe treatment for patients with both MS and LD. Well-designed clinical trials and follow-up studies are needed to prove the long-term efficacy and safety of hESC therapy in the treatment of patients with MS and LD.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Abnormal testicular descent can either be undescended or, less commonly, ectopic. Most undescended testes complete the course of descent by the first year of life only if these remain in the normal path of descent. The deviation of the testis may occur to an ectopic location during the transinguinal phase. Of the known ectopic sites, the anterior abdominal wall is the rarest site of testicular ectopia and to our knowledge only 3 cases of this nature have been reported in the available literature to date.  CASE REPORT This rare case of testicular ectopia occurred in a 3-day-old boy in whom the right scrotal sac was empty; on abdominal ultrasound, the right testis was found in the subcutaneous tissues of the right antero-lateral abdominal wall. These findings were confirmed on abdominal MRI, where the right testis was seen beneath the skin between the subcutaneous tissues and external oblique aponeurosis. No aponeurotic or muscular defect was appreciable under the abdominal wall. The neonate underwent orchiopexy at the age of 6 months and remained uneventful postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative imaging is recommended to detect and confirm the ectopic site as well as the morphology of testis, thereby increasing the chance of surveillance and preservation of an ectopic testis. Imaging can serve as preoperative road mapping to localize the exact site for surgical exploration of an ectopic testis if there is no apparent or palpable swelling over the anterior abdominal wall.},

As the pharmacology or chemistry of the toxin is still unknown, antidote or treatment to chelonitoxism is unavailable. The symptoms can vary from common gastro-intestinal symptoms to neurological manifestations and even death. This case report of community poisoning following consumption of turtle meat includes the death of an adult male (56 yrs.) being reported for the first time in the Great Nicobar Island, Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands, India in August 2012. The patient encountered common gastrointestinal symptoms after one day of ingestion of green turtle flesh and later, he developed neurological symptoms and did not respond to symptomatic treatment and expired after four days after the consumption. However, out of 30 villagers who took the same food, six others developed symptoms and recovered within a period of 3-7 days while two pets (a dog and a cat) died within 24 hours as they were fed with the same food. In spite of several existing wildlife protection acts, catching a turtle and making them a source of food-celebration is quite common in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal which includes A&N Islands. A proper monitoring and follow-up of the food-borne diseases along with a wide range of explorative health education protocol should be implemented especially for the people who are not reachable via media to avoid such incidents in future.},

Despite a complete microsurgical excision, two months later, the tumor recurred locally with a rapid increase in size causing a progressive worsening of neurological symptoms. A diagnosis of malignant schwannoma was made for the recurrent tumor on the basis of the microscopic findings of high cellularity, moderate pleomorphism, and the presence of mitotic cells. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging performed a month after the second surgery unexpectedly showed definite tumor enlargement. She remained clinically stable following the third debulking of the tumor and adjuvant radiotherapy.

To diagnose the Brugada syndrome, 1 ECG criterion and 1 clinical criterion should exist. Brugada syndrome can be associated with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation; the only treatment proven to prevent sudden death is placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, which is recommended in symptomatic patients or in those with ventricular tachycardia induced during electrophysiologic studies and a type 1 ECG pattern of Brugada syndrome.

CASE REPORT A 51-year-old female with lifelong neurogenic bladder secondary to spina bifida occulta presented with progressive symptoms of daily urge fecal incontinence as well as hard bowel movements associated with straining and a sensation of incomplete evacuation requiring manual disimpaction. Pelvic floor testing showed poor ability to squeeze the anal sphincter, which indicated sphincter weakness as a major contributor to her fecal incontinence symptoms. Additionally, on defecography she was unable to widen her posterior anorectal angle or relax the anal sphincter during defecation consistent with dyssynergic defecation. A sacral nerve stimulator was placed for management of her fecal incontinence. Interestingly, her constipation also dramatically improved with sacral neuromodulation. CONCLUSIONS This unique case highlights the emerging role of sacral nerve stimulation in the treatment of complex pelvic floor dysfunction with improvement in symptoms beyond fecal incontinence in a patient with dyssynergic-type constipation.},

In contrast, auditory functions reflecting intensity or frequency discriminations (difference limens) were only minimally impaired. Pure tone audiometry showed a moderate (50 dB) bilateral hearing loss with a disproportionate severe loss of word intelligibility. Those auditory evoked potentials that were preserved included (1) cochlear microphonics reflecting hair cell activity; (2) cortical sustained potentials reflecting processing of slowly changing signals; and (3) long-latency cognitive components (P300, processing negativity) reflecting endogenous auditory cognitive processes. Both the evoked potential and perceptual deficits are attributed to changes in temporal encoding of acoustic signals perhaps occurring at the synapse between hair cell and eighth nerve dendrites. The results from this patient are discussed in relation to previously published cases with absent auditory evoked potentials and preserved hearing.},

Development of high-output heart failure may be an underappreciated complication in patients who have undergone this procedure. When a large proportion of arterial blood is shunted from the left-sided circulation to the right-sided circulation via the fistula, the increase in preload can lead to increased cardiac output. Over time, the demands of an increased workload may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and eventual heart failure. Patients may present with the usual signs of high-output heart failure including tachycardia, elevated pulse pressure, hyperkinetic precordium, and jugular venous distension. Typically, the AV fistula is quite large and is likely located in the upper arm, more proximal to the heart. Routine access flow monitoring should demonstrate blood flows (Qa) >2000 ML/min. Echocardiogram may reveal either a low or high left ventricular ejection fraction, and right-heart catheterization demonstrates an elevated cardiac output with a low to normal systemic vascular resistance. When addressing the problem of high-output heart failure, the nephrologist is faced with the dilemma of preventing progression of heart failure at the expense of loss of vascular access. Nevertheless, treatment should be directed at correcting the underlying problem by surgical banding or ligation of the fistula.},

Noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues are the pathologic hallmark of the condition. We report the lifelong severe disease course in a 14-year-old Caucasian boy with sporadic Blau syndrome. Unusually, granulomatous dermatitis started in the first week of life. Whereas skin involvement faded away spontaneously in subsequent years, polyarthritis and anterior uveitis appeared in the second and third year of life respectively. Mutational analysis of the NOD2 gene revealed a missense mutation (R334W) previously detected in other Blau syndrome pedigrees.

Although the patients had tolerated propranolol therapy for years without difficulty, and high-dose diltiazem monotherapy with an excellent clinical response, the combination of diltiazem and propranolol resulted in the development of congestive heart failure. Thus, although generally well tolerated, given the suitable scenario of reduced left ventricular function, the combination of diltiazem and a beta blocker may adversely affect left ventricular performance.},

In a cardiac catheterization study, cardiac index, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, LV wall motion, and coronary arteries were shown to be normal. However, atrial pacing demonstrated a negative force-frequency relationship (a decrease in arterial blood pressure with higher pacing rates). Pathological study showed hemosiderin accumulation in his liver, but not in his myocardial tissue. As earlier studies have reported that iron may play an important role in oxidative cell damage and that this ion can enter cardiomyocytes through L-type Ca(2+) channels, we started an iron chelating agent (deferoxamine) and a calcium channel blocker (verapamil) in this case. Eighteen months later, his serum ferritin levels fell significantly without any changes in anemia. The TEI index was normalized (0.21) and the atrial pacing provoked a less negative force-frequency relationship. Thus, this combination treatment may be effective in iron overload cardiomyopathy at its early stage, when LV diastolic dysfunction is dominant and LV systolic dysfunction is only latent.},

At age 68, he noticed diplopia, due to superior rectus muscle palsy of the right eye. At age 70, he noticed lipoma on the right arm. The pathology of his muscle revealed some ragged-red fibers, and focal cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Hence, he may have a pathogenetic mechanism in common with CPEO (chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia) or mitochondria-related autoimmune disorder associated with mononeuropathy. He had the rate of 0.102% for heteroplasmy of 3243 mitochondrial DNA mutation in leukocytes. This case's heteroplasmy level is the smallest among the reported cases of MDM3243 in the literature. 3243 mitochondrial DNA mutation is known to induce a lack of uridine-modification in tRNA(Leu(UUR)) at the first letter of the anticodon, with which the third letter of the codon pairs, and decline of the pairing of the anticodon of tRNA with the codon of mRNA, suggesting the termination of polypeptide-elongation to generate premature proteins. Therefore, we speculate that these premature proteins may accumulate overtime, thereby affecting cells in target organs.},

Barth syndrome, an X-linked mitochondrial cardioskeletal myopathy, was diagnosed by genetic testing at autopsy. Barth syndrome presents in infancy or childhood with cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, growth delays, and cyclic neutropenia. Other associated laboratory findings can include hypocholesterolemia, relative monocytosis, low prealbumin, low plasma carnitine, and lactic acidosis. The classic echocardiogram finding is left ventricular noncompaction, although not always present. Until recently, the most reliable biochemical finding has been 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. However, quantitative analysis must be specifically requested for results to be reliable. Recently, a confirmatory tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin high-pressure liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry blood test has become available. Genetic testing is also confirmatory and details the underlying mutation. Diagnosis is often missed or delayed and early diagnosis improves survival. The purpose of this case report is to encourage physicians to include Barth syndrome in the differential for cardiomyopathy of uncertain etiology in males, especially in the presence of growth delays, hypotonia, neutropenia, and/or family history of pediatric male death of unknown etiology.},

Gross anatomical illustrations have shown that the psoas muscle lies lateral to the L4-5 vertebrae and subsequently thins and dissociates from the vertebral body at L5-S1 in a ventrolateral course. A "rising psoas" may influence the location of the lumbar plexus and result in transient neurological injury on lateral approach to the spine. It is postulated that axial back pain may be exacerbated by anatomical changes of paraspinal musculature as a direct result of degenerative spine conditions. To their knowledge, the authors present the first reported case of a more anteriorly positioned psoas muscle and its resolution following correction of spondylolisthesis in a 62-year-old woman. This case highlights the dynamic nature of degenerative spinal disorders and illustrates that psoas muscle position can be affected by sagittal balance. Normal anatomical positioning can be restored following correction of spinal alignment.},

We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who developed severe systolic left ventricular failure with impaired contractility of the right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, and clots in the left ventricular cavity during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. The patient was initially diagnosed with early breast cancer and underwent surgery on her left breast. She received 6 cycles of anthracycline chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy in the left breast area, then 5 cycles of trastuzumab. After the fifth cycle of trastuzumab, she experienced dyspnoea and leg edema. Fluid was detected in the pleural cavities but no lung metastases were identified. Echocardiography was performed, revealing a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (10%) with impaired contractility of the right ventricle and pulmonary hypertension. Standard medication for heart failure resulted in complete recovery of normal systolic and diastolic function of the left and right ventricles. The combination of low molecular weight heparin and acetylsalicylic acid completely resolved the thrombotic complications. The patient regained her full range of social, occupational, and family activities. This case study is the first to demonstrate the manageability and reversibility of trastuzumab-related cardiac complications in a patient who had developed severe heart failure complicated with left ventricular thrombosis during sequential anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer. The findings contradict other opinions that trastuzumab-related acute heart failure is analogous to stunning or hibernation and recovers without specific cardiac treatment.},

We considered the hyponatremia's cause as SIADH. We suspected that tacrolimus was the disease's cause, so we used cyclosporine instead, plus hypertonic sodium plus water intake restriction, which improved the hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia manifested by SIADH is a rare, serious complication post-liver transplantation.},

Furthermore, the lesion responsible for prosopagnosia, which frequently occurs with landmark agnosia, seems to involve the posterior half of the lingual and fusiform gyri.

Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction rapidly progressed, and she died of heart failure on the 14th hospital day. Immunohistochemical study of the myocardial tissue showed mild to moderate cell infiltration, mainly consisting of natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and T helper cells. Perforin, a cytolytic factor, was expressed in the infiltrating CTLs and NK cells, indicating that these cells were activated killer cells. Furthermore, human leukocyte antigen classes I and II, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, as well as costimulatory molecules B7-1, B7-2, and CD40, all of which are known not to be expressed in cardiac myocytes under normal conditions, were moderately to strongly expressed in cardiac myocytes. There was no detectable level of enterovirus genomes in the polymerase chain reaction products from the myocardial tissue of this patient. These findings strongly suggest that the infiltrating killer cells recognized cardiac myocytes as target cells and directly damaged them by releasing perforin. Enhanced expression of these antigens may have played an important role in the activation and cytotoxicity of the infiltrating killer cells. Absence of enterovirus genomes in the myocardial tissue may suggest that this autoimmune process is primarily induced by PSS.},

We performed coronary angiography, which showed complete obstruction of the circumflex coronary artery. We determined that the condition was caused by infective endocarditis.

Genetic studies of TAZ revealed a disease-causing mutation (p.Gly216Arg) in this patient.

Computed tomography shows a nodular lesion measuring 7 × 4 cm in his left lung. Obstruction of the left inferior lobar bronchus was observed, and endobronchial biopsy suggested angiosarcoma. Left pneumonectomy was performed. On macroscopic examination of the cut surface, multiple nodular lesions were observed particularly in portions around branches of pulmonary artery along bronchioles. Histological examination revealed vascular channel-like structure with vague lumen formations by atypical polygonal or spindle-shaped neoplastic cells. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells are positive for FLI-1, ERG, CD31 and von Willebrand factor/factor VIII-related antigen, but not CD34. Angiosarcoma is a particularly rare form of primary pulmonary tumors, and this case report describes its unique macroscopic growth pattern in the lung.},

Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies using the anti-complex IV antibody revealed that the contents of subunits 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of complex IV were markedly diminished and that subunit 2 was almost absent. Immunohistochemistry of the muscle tissue revealed a considerable accumulation of immunoreactive materials of complex IV in the ragged-red fibers. The immunoblots using the anti-NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase antibody demonstrated that the contents of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits were 47% of control and that the contents of three subunits were considerably decreased. The contents of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase subunits were also somewhat low (77% of control) and one of the minor contaminants detected in the control was completely absent. High-resolution one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-gel electrophoresis disclosed that six additional unidentified polypeptides in the control were markedly diminished or completely missing. These results demonstrate that the molecular defects in the mitochondrial electron-transfer chain are more extensive than would be expected from either spectral analysis or enzyme activity measurements alone, and involve not only complex IV but also NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase and several unidentified mitochondrial proteins.},

A 38-year-old white homosexual man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and no history of opportunistic infections was maintained on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including hydroxyurea, stavudine, indinavir, ritonavir, and adefovir dipivoxil. Histologic examination of the renal biopsy showed severe acute tubular degenerative changes primarily affecting the proximal tubules. On ultrastructural examination, proximal tubular mitochondria were extremely enlarged and dysmorphic with loss and disorientation of their cristae. Functional histochemical stains for mitochondrial enzymes revealed focal tubular deficiency of cytochrome C oxidase (COX), a respiratory chain enzyme partially encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), with preservation of succinate dehydrogenase, a respiratory chain enzyme entirely encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Immunoreactivity for COX subunit I (encoded by mtDNA) was weak to undetectable in most tubular epithelial cells, although immunoreactivities for COX subunit IV and iron sulfur subunit of respiratory complex III (both encoded by nDNA) were well preserved in all renal tubular cells. Single-renal tubule polymerase chain reaction revealed marked reduction of mtDNA in COX-immunodeficient renal tubules. We conclude that adefovir-induced nephrotoxicity is mediated by depletion of mtDNA from proximal tubular cells through inhibition of mtDNA replication. This novel form of nephrotoxicity may serve as a prototype for other forms of renal toxicity caused by reverse transcriptase inhibitors.},

The patient was treated with chemotherapy and radiation and followed up in our hospital. Eight years after the orchiectomy, the patient (75 years old) developed left pleural tumor and pleural effusion, and a biopsy was performed. The biopsy revealed a medullary malignant tumor consisting of small round and spindle cells. The following three possibilities were considered: recurrent lymphoma, mesothelioma, and small cell carcinoma.

PAM is infrequently complicated by pulmonary hypertension, the cause of which is unclear. The author in this paper found that the pulmonary hypertension was caused by a marked decrease in pulmonary vascular beds. Here, an autopsy case of PAM with a marked cor pulmonale is reported. A 14-year-old woman was found to have an abnormal pulmonary shadow, but the cause was unclear. At 24 years, she was diagnosed with a diffuse pulmonary abnormal shadow. At 42 years, she was diagnosed with PAM by imaging techniques. Her condition gradually worsened and she had to be treated with oxygen. She died of respiratory failure at 54 years. An autopsy revealed severe PAM and marked cor pulmonale. The heart weighed 360 g and right ventricular thickness was 10 mm (normal, 2-3 mm). Microscopically, the alveolar space was diffusely filled with microliths, and heart failure cells were recognized. Bone formations were scattered. The alveolar walls showed fibrous thickening, and pulmonary arteries showed atherosclerosis. The right ventricle showed marked cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic severe liver congestion was noted. A morphometric analysis using CD34-stained specimens showed a marked decrease (one tenth) in pulmonary capillary beds (capillary number: 8.6 +/- 3.1 per image), compared with normal lungs obtained from two other autopsies (85.3 +/- 9.4 and 96.2 +/- 10,3). It was concluded that the cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension in the present case were caused by the marked decrease of the pulmonary arterial vascular beds. More research is required regarding the etiology and treatment of PAM.},

Imaging modalities showed a large tumor of the posterior aspect of the uterus, and enucleation was performed. The tumor was attached to the posterior uterus, similar to subserosal leiomyoma. No attachment to the gastrointestinal organs was recognized. The tumor was soft, tan, and measured 13 x 15 x 12 cm. The tumor consisted of cellular spindle cells with focal necrotic areas. Mitotic figures were noted in 3 of 50 high-power fields. The tumor cells were positive for KIT, CD34, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, and vimentin, but negative for alpha-smooth muscle actin, S100 protein, p53 protein, HMB45, and desmin. Ki-67 labeling was 3%. Five normal uteruses used as controls showed KIT-positive Cajal-like mesenchymal cell scattering in the myometrium. Genetic analyses of the c-kit gene (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (exons 12 and 18) revealed a point mutation at codon 559 (GTT-->GAT) of exon 11 of the c-kit gene. Other exons showed no abnormalities. This case shows that gastrointestinal stromal tumor may occur in the uterus.},

Imaging modalities revealed a 5 x 4 cm tumor in the middle mediastinum near the bronchial carina. No other tumors were detected in the body including the lungs. Video-assisted thoracoscopy confirmed the mediastinal tumor, and a large incisional biopsy was performed. The tumor was histologically small cell carcinoma. An immunohistochemical study revealed positive reactions for cytokeratins (AE1/3, polyclonal), synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, CD56, KIT, and PDGFRA, and negative reactions for chromogranin, CEA, CD45, CD20, and CD3. Ki-67 labeling showed a value of 80%. A molecular genetic analysis using PCR-direct sequencing identified no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. The patient received radiation and chemotherapy, and the tumor was fully resolved. The patient has remained free of recurrence for 6 years after the first presentation.

    abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome (LS). COX consists of ten nuclear-encoded and three mtDNA-encoded structural subunits. Although the nucleotide sequences of all 13 genes are known, no mutation was found in nuclear-encoded subunit genes of COX-deficiency patients. Zhu et al. (1998) and Tiranti et al. (1998) found nine mutations in the surfeit 1 (SURF1) gene in LS families with COX deficiency. The mouse surfeit gene cluster consists of six closely spaced housekeeping genes unrelated by sequence homology. Except for the Surf3 gene, the function is still not known. The juxtaposition of at least five of the surfeit genes is conserved between birds and mammals. We identified two novel mutations of SURF1 in a Japanese LS patient with COX deficiency using direct sequencing analysis. Firstly, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide position 790 (790delAG) in exon 8 was found, which shifts the reading frame such that the mutant protein has a completely different amino acid sequence from codon 264 to the premature stop codon at 290. Secondly, we found a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 820, resulting in the substitution of tyrosine by aspartic acid at codon 274 (Y274D). We also studied the parents' genes, and found that the Y274D mutation was in his father and the 790delAG mutation was in his mother heterozygously. Therefore, we concluded that the patient was a compound heterozygote with these mutations. These are the first pathogenetic SURF1 mutations identified in a Japanese family.},

Lesion of these nerves may be a rare complication of airway management. Herein, a case of Tapia's Syndrome complicating transoral intubation during general anaesthesia in a rhinoplasty operation, together with a review of pertinent literature to evaluate the incidence and the possible pathogenic mechanism of the lesion. There are recent reports in the literature on mono or bilateral paralysis of the XII or laryngeal recurrent nerve after use of laryngeal mask with a pathogenic mechanism of compression. Furthermore, there are reports, following oro-tracheal intubation, of recurrent laryngeal paralysis, likely legacies to the compression of the anterior branch of inferior laryngeal nerve by the cuff of the oro-tracheal tube against the postero-medial part of the thyroid cartilage. Hypoglossal nerve damage could be caused by a stretching of the nerve against the greater horn of the hyoid bone by a laryngeal mask or oro-tracheal tube or compression of the posterior part of the laryngoscope or oro-tracheal tube. In our case, the lesion probably occurred as the result of a two-fold compressive mechanism: on one hand, compression by the cuff of the endo-tracheal tube due to excessive throat pack in the oro-pharynx; on the other hand a prolonged stretching mechanism of these nerves may have occurred due to excessive anterior and lateral flexion of the head. From the data reported in the literature, as in our case, complete recovery of function is generally achieved within the first six months. This progressive recovery of function suggests nerve damage of a neuro-praxic type, which is typical of compression injury. In conclusion, the response of this rare complication confirms the importance not only of the position of the head and patient on the operating table but also the meticulous and correct performance of the routine manoeuvres of airway management.},

Although the mortality in heart failure patients is attributable primarily to heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias, the mechanism of death after cardiomyoplasty is not well characterized. We describe the clinical course of a patient undergoing cardiomyoplasty and discuss the role of combined use with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. A 39-year-old man with congestive heart failure due to a massive anterior wall myocardial infarction was evaluated for latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty. The patient was in NYHA Functional Class III due to heart failure. He did not have any significant exertional or rest angina. During a Naughton stress test, the patient could exercise for 10 minutes, achieving 4 METS. Pulmonary function study showed a peak V O2 of 22.1 mL/min per kg. Radionuclide angiography demonstrated that the anterior wall was akinetic with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%. Cardiac hemodynamic studies suggested moderate pulmonary hypertension, elevated wedge pressure, and suboptimal response to exercise. A Holter recording showed frequent ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiomyoplasty was preferred to heart transplantation because the patient did not have end-stage heart failure. Postoperatively, the patient required low doses of dopamine. He developed recurrent, sustained, and hemodynamically significant episodes of ventricular tachycardia. He was treated with a combination of amiodarone and procainamide. He died 2 days postoperatively with ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of death in patients with heart failure. Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty appears to be a promising but unproven therapy in such patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This case report describes a 22-year-old nulliparous Caucasian woman with known MEN2A syndrome, who underwent thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma in childhood and excision of left sided pheochromocytoma at the age of 19. She was found to have a recurrence of pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland during pregnancy at 16 weeks of gestation and was oddly normotensive. Catecholamine effects were blocked with phenoxybenzamine and she delivered by an uneventful elective caesarean section at 36 weeks gestation. She underwent a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy six weeks postpartum, followed by lifelong corticosteroid replacement.},

    abstract = {Extensive myocardial bridging in the left anterior descending coronary artery was found in a 46 year old survivor of sudden cardiac near-death. Positron emission tomography and dobutamine stress echocardiography revealed ischaemia in the myocardium distal to the bridging. Spasm was excluded as cause of the ischaemia by intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine. Further evaluation of the haemodynamic importance of the bridging using intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements revealed an abnormal flow reserve. Dobutamine stress during coronary angiography caused increased mechanical compression during diastole. This was accompanied by multiple premature ventricular contractions. After a debridging operation the flow velocity reserve was normal. The abnormalities found during dobutamine stress had disappeared. Unexpectedly, a spasm was inducible. This may have been due to local oedema or scar formation after the operation. For the evaluation of the haemodynamic importance of myocardial bridging, intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements and angiography during dobutamine stress may be helpful in clinical decision making.},

She suffered recurrence after 2 years and was considered inoperable. Biopsy revealed a malignant chordoma with no sarcomatous differentiation. Chordoma is an uncommon malignant bone tumor originating from remnants of the embryonal notochord, occurring mostly along the axial skeleton, at the extremity of the vertebral spine, and is least common in the thoracic region. Differential diagnosis is problematic and biopsy is helpful particularly if considered inoperable. Thoracic chordomas of the malignant type manifest as cord or root compression. Classical malignant chordomas must be distinguished from chondroid, benign, or other types of chordomas, since the biological behavior and clinical features are distinct. However, the differential diagnosis cannot be based on histological examination, but long-term follow up is required. Most patients have extradural and intraspinal tissue extension at the time of diagnosis, which makes complete resection impossible. Aggressive surgery without violation of surgical borders is the best choice in the treatment of thoracic chordoma. Thoracic chordoma is a recurring neoplasm and is prone to dissemination and sarcomatous differentiation despite its slow-growing nature.},

Albeit extremely rare, coexistence of endometriosis within LPD lesions has also reported. Herein, we report the seventh documented case of LPD coexisting with endometriosis within the same lesions and review the pathogenesis of this lesion. A 42-year-old Japanese female presented with an abdominal tumor. Computed tomography revealed a tumorous lesion in the right ovary and multiple small nodules in the abdominal cavity. Under a clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination, resection of these lesions was performed. Histopathological study of the disseminated peritoneal nodules revealed proliferation of interlacing bundles of spindle cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and bland cigar-shaped nuclei. Mitotic figures were hardly seen. The peritoneal nodules of the rectum had cystic cavities within the spindle cell bundles, and endometrial glands and stroma were present around the cystic cavities and spindle cells. The resected tissues of the ovary and cecum showed the same histopathological features. Accordingly, a diagnosis of LPD with endometriosis within the same lesions was made. A possible origin of LPD is thought to be the submesothelial multipotential stem cells, also referred to as the secondary müllerian system. The presence of endometrial tissues within LPD lesions, as seen in the present case, also support this hypothesis because endometrial tissues are also derived from the müllerian system.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND Hypercalcemia associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an ominous sign. Although rare, several cases have been reported and multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms have been independently proposed. We present a patient case and a literature review of the clinical presentation and mechanisms of CML-associated hypercalcemia. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old male with a past medical history of CML diagnosed six years earlier, presented to the emergency department with one week of acute confusion, disorientation, polyuria, and polydipsia. On physical examination, we observed tachycardia, altered mental status, and dehydration. Blood analysis revealed leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and marked hypercalcemia (18.6 mg/dL). His chest CT scan showed diffuse lytic lesions and bone destruction concerning for diffuse bone marrow involvement. The patient was diagnosed with hypercalcemia in the context of a CML blast phase. Treatment with hydration, calcitonin, and zoledronic acid lead to control of his symptoms and normalization of his serum calcium levels. After discharged, the patient was maintained on palliative treatment and zoledronic acid management without new episodes of hypercalcemia. However, eight months later, the patient died. CONCLUSIONS Evidence from the literature demonstrates a highly variable clinical presentation of CML-associated hypercalcemia, commonly occurring during an accelerated or a blast phase, and associated with poor survival. Multiple mechanisms could be involved and are not exclusive of each other. Better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in CML-associated hypercalcemia could lead to improvement in clinical and laboratory evaluation of these patients and be the foundation for the development of better management strategies and possibly target-directed therapy to positively improve prognosis.},

Muscle biopsy specimens revealed fibres with a "ragged" appearance with increased mitochondria and lipid droplets. Biochemical investigation revealed a deficiency of complex bc1 (complex III) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Genetic analysis did not show either deletions or known mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) showed defective energy metabolism in brain and gastrocnemius muscle. A decreased phosphocreatine (PCr) content was found in the occipital lobes accompanied by normal inorganic phosphate (Pi) and cytosolic pH. These findings represented evidence of a high cytosolic adenosine diphosphate concentration and a relatively high rate of metabolism accompanied by a low phosphorylation potential. Muscle 31P-MRS showed a high Pi content at rest, abnormal exercise transfer pattern and a low rate of PCr post-exercise recovery. These findings suggested a deficit of mitochondrial function. Therapy with vitamins K3 and C normalized brain 31P-MRS indices, whereas it did not affect muscle bioenergetic metabolism. In this patient, the endocrinological disorder is putatively due to a mitochondrial cytopathy. Although an unknown mtDNA mutation cannot be ruled out, the genetic defect may lie in the nuclear genome.},

The patient had been diagnosed with PBC 12 years previously, and had received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. The platelet count decreased from approximately 60 x 10(9)/L to 8 x 10(9)/L, and the association of decompensated liver cirrhosis (PBC) with ITP was diagnosed. Steroid and immune gamma globulin therapy were successful in increasing the platelet count. Interestingly, human leukocyte antigen genotyping detected the alleles DQB1*0601 and DRB1*0803, which are related to both PBC and ITP in Japanese patients. This case suggests common immunogenetic factors might be involved in the development of PBC and ITP.},

A 53-year-old male presented at our Department with a 4-year clinical history of diagnosed cicatricial pemphigoid. The patient was affected by ocular and urinary symptoms and presented with nasal obstruction and dysphonia. Nasal endoscopy revealed crusting and synechiae with pale and atrophic mucosa. Computed tomography examination showed hypodense-hyperdense material occupying all paranasal sinuses and nasal fossae. Laryngoscopy showed anterior para-commessural and inter-arytenoidal synechiae. The patient underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for incision of synechiae and removal of scars and inflammatory material from all sinuses. Nasal splints were then inserted. A wait-and-see policy was adopted for the laryngeal lesion. One year later, the splints were removed; the upper airways were still free and there were no signs of nasal obstruction. An endoscopic approach appears to be efficacious in the surgical treatment of nasal cicatricial pemphigoid, and long-term stenting may be necessary to avoid recurrence. Although surgery has not a curative role in long-term therapeutic strategies, it may, nonetheless, improve the quality of life and ensure good nasal respiration.},

Although an accurate diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnant patients is thus of crucial importance, the diagnostic management of suspected PE is challenging for this specific patient category. As D-dimer levels increase physiologically throughout pregnancy, the optimal D-dimer threshold to rule out PE during pregnancy remains unknown. Available clinical decision rules, such as the Wells score and the revised Geneva rule, have not been evaluated in pregnant patients. Also, although ventilation-perfusion (V-Q) lung scan and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) can be used in the pregnant population, both modalities have disadvantages of radiation exposure to both mother and foetus. Because of these uncertainties, clinical guidelines provide contradicting recommendations with weak levels of evidence. In this review, we illustrate these dilemmas and provide practice recommendation for the diagnostic management of suspected PE in pregnancy using two real-life patient cases.},

The patient was admitted to the ICU of a tertiary hospital and failed traditional maximal pharmacological management. Adjunctive therapy with FMT given through gastroscopy resulted in resolution of the C. difficile-related symptoms. Although there is a growing experience with FMT for recurrent C. difficile infection, published evidence in severe disease is very limited. In a landscape of increasingly severe C. difficile infection, adjunctive FMT may be considered a useful early treatment option.},

    abstract = {Respiratory abnormalities are often overlooked; however, because of their potential comorbidity, they must be analyzed to determine the most effective treatment for patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Among various theories on respiratory abnormalities in PD, "upper airway obstruction" and "restrictive respiratory disorders" are 2 of the most accepted etiologies; both appear to be related to basal ganglia dysfunction. Complex vocal cord muscle dysfunction contributes to stridor, which can be a manifestation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction. Stridor is a lethal form of upper airway obstruction in PD patients; its most frequent causes are bilateral vocal cord palsy, laryngeal spasms, and dystonia of the supra-laryngeal muscle. Several previous studies have suggested that levodopa administration induces a significant improvement of both lung function and symptoms of parkinsonian syndrome.},

During surveillance colonoscopy, a tumor was found in the rectum that was pathologically diagnosed as CARC from the resected specimen. Abdominal computed tomography also revealed a localized dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a band-like stricture. This remarkable tumor lesion was not observed in the hepatic duct. Left hepatectomy was performed because of the suspicion of possible ICC at the stenosis of the hepatic duct. The presence of ICC was confirmed at the lesion causing the stricture. The pathological diagnosis from the resected specimen was ICC based on PSC. Adjuvant chemotherapy for ICC was performed for 6 months. Neither cancer has recurred for 2.5 years after hepatectomy.

The postoperative clinical course was good and the patient remains healthy. Review of the literature found meningiomas associated with Werner syndrome occur about two times more frequently in men than in women, and typically in the fourth decade. Most meningiomas associated with Werner syndrome are benign, but are sometimes complicated with extracranial tumors such as sarcoma, thyroid carcinoma, and others.

During infancy the boy was irritable and hypotonus was noticed. Early motor development was delayed, although mental development seemed normal until eight months of age. Early neurological signs were nystagmus, hypertonus and optic atrophy. Severe seizures and mental retardation developed subsequently. Major findings on neuroradiological investigation were from the brainstem, thalami and white matter compatible with LS. Spectrophotometric analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondria showed a profound COX deficiency and a marked complex I deficiency. Enzyme-histochemical analysis showed reduced COX activity in the majority of the muscle fibres. There were no ragged red fibres. The T 5537i mutation was found in a high proportion (> 95 %) in blood, liver and muscle tissue of the patient and in blood of the patient's mother (81 %). This mutation has previously been described in one family in which one child had a very high proportion of the T 5537i mutation and clinical features of LS. We conclude that, although mtDNA mutations are considered to be rare in LS with COX deficiency, the T 5537i mutation should be screened for in cases of LS with COX deficiency when SURF1 gene mutations have been excluded, especially when complex I activity is also decreased.},

Gross examination of the tumor obtained by an exploratory surgery showed a solid area in a simple cyst. The ovarian tumor was diagnosed as a high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Early in the post-operative course, this patient developed fever of unknown origin with central nervous system manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple space-occupying lesions. When we reviewed the histological sections, atypical lymphocytes were found in the lumina of small vessels of almost the entire ovary. These cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a by immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of IVLBCL coexisting with HGSC was finally made. Although radiation therapy for brain lesions was performed and rituximab was administered, she died two months after the operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of IVLBCL incidentally identified in HGSC through microscopic examination.

The majority of these support the various biochemical pathways that are active in these organelles. Individuals with an oxidative phosphorylation disorder of unknown cause provide a unique opportunity to identify novel genes implicated in mitochondrial biology. We identified a homozygous deletion of CEP89 in a patient with isolated complex IV deficiency, intellectual disability and multisystemic problems. CEP89 is a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved gene of unknown function. Immunocytochemistry and cellular fractionation experiments showed that CEP89 is present both in the cytosol and in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Furthermore, we ascertained in vitro that downregulation of CEP89 resulted in a severe decrease in complex IV in-gel activity and altered mobility, suggesting that the complex is aberrantly formed. Two-dimensional BN-SDS gel analysis revealed that CEP89 associates with a high-molecular weight complex. Together, these data confirm a role for CEP89 in mitochondrial metabolism. In addition, we modeled CEP89 loss of function in Drosophila. Ubiquitous knockdown of fly Cep89 decreased complex IV activity and resulted in complete lethality. Furthermore, Cep89 is required for mitochondrial integrity, membrane depolarization and synaptic transmission of photoreceptor neurons, and for (sub)synaptic organization of the larval neuromuscular junction. Finally, we tested neuronal Cep89 knockdown flies in the light-off jump reflex habituation assay, which revealed its role in learning. We conclude that CEP89 proteins play an important role in mitochondrial metabolism, especially complex IV activity, and are required for neuronal and cognitive function across evolution.},

Symptoms failed to improve despite the treatment. A subsequent CT scan of sinuses revealed a radiopaque foreign body in the nasal cavity.

After admission, a transesophageal echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 40%. Because enteral administration of drugs was impossible, intravenous enalaprilat 2 mg once a day for 1 day followed by sublingual captopril 25 mg twice a day were started. Blood samples were taken before and after administration. After 1 day of sublingual captopril treatment the angiotensin II level decreased with more than 50%, comparable to the decrease seen after intravenous administration of enalaprilat. Sublingual captopril has been used in the treatment of hypertensive crisis and heart failure. Although frequently reported, no study has investigated the effect on angiotensin II levels after sublingual administration in heart failure patients. This case-report demonstrated that sublingual administration of 25 mg captopril twice a day yielded a considerable decrease in angiotensin II plasma levels which was comparable to the effect seen after an intravenous administration of 2 mg enalaprilat.},

We describe a family whose first-born boy developed characteristic features of LS. Severe COX deficiency in muscle was caused by a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in SURF1. Segregation analysis of this mutation in the family was incompatible with autosomal recessive inheritance but consistent with a maternal disomy. Haplotype analysis of microsatellite markers confirmed isodisomy involving nearly the complete long arm of chromosome 9 (9q21-9tel). No additional physical abnormalities were present in the boy, suggesting that there are no imprinted genes on the long arm of chromosome 9 which are crucial for developmental processes. This case of segmental isodisomy illustrates that genotyping of parents is crucial for correct genetic counseling.},

Diverse pathological features have been identified, and their disease relevance remains much debated. Here, we describe two illuminating patients with frontotemporal dementia due to the C9orf72 repeat expansion. Case 1 was a 65-year-old female with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia accompanied by focal degeneration in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and medial pulvinar thalamus. At autopsy, widespread RNA foci and dipeptide repeat protein inclusions were observed, but TDP-43 pathology was nearly absent, even in degenerating brain regions. Case 2 was a 74-year-old female with atypical frontotemporal dementia-motor neuron disease who underwent temporal lobe resection for epilepsy 5 years prior to her first frontotemporal dementia symptoms. Archival surgical resection tissue contained RNA foci, dipeptide repeat protein inclusions, and loss of nuclear TDP-43 but no TDP-43 inclusions despite florid TDP-43 inclusions at autopsy 8 years after first symptoms. These findings suggest that C9orf72-specific phenomena may impact brain structure and function and emerge before first symptoms and TDP-43 aggregation.},

We present a 30-year-old woman with new-onset focal epilepsy leading to the diagnosis of CADASIL. The neuropsychological testing revealed no cognitive impairment. Interictal EEG demonstrated spikes and polyspikes with low amplitude over the right occipital region during NREM sleep. MRI showed white-matter hyperintensities on both hemispheres with confluent lesions at the right parieto-occipital junction, with juxtacortical components. Like in multiple sclerosis, we can suppose that this type of white matter lesions, close to the cortex, may be causative of seizures.},

Beside the patient, the same mutation was detected in patient's mother and grandmother. In contrast to the so far reported patients with mutations in the same region of G4.5 (TAZ) gene, the patient described here has only a mild and transitory clinical presentation. This could be attributed to alternative splicing of G4.5 (TAZ) gene, since mRNA lacking exon 6 (with 535delC mutation) was detected. Genetic analysis of the G4.5 (TAZ) gene was helpful for establishing the precise diagnosis of Barth syndrome and for adequate genetic counselling. Predicting the phenotype on the basis of mutations is unreliable especially if mutations are localised in alternatively spliced exons of the G4.5 (TAZ) gene which may result in a milder clinical presentation than expected.},

The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, measured using radionuclide ventriculography with labeled red blood cells prior to transplantation, was 24%, and, after 30 days, it increased to 32% with no change in the medicamentous schedule. The following measurements were assessed before and 30 days after transplantation: left ventricular end diastolic diameter (82 mm and 76 mm, respectively); Minnesota living with heart failure questionaire score (55 and 06, respectively); and distance walked in the 6-minute walking test (513 m and 683 m, respectively).

Arterial stiffness and vascular calcifications are independent predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5D population. According to the guidelines, patients on renal replacement therapy represent a very high cardiovascular risk class.Case report.We report the case of a 67-year-old hypertensive male patient, known with CKD stage 5D on hemodialysis (three times per week), secondary bone mineral disease, admitted for progressive right leg pain. The physical examination detected right dorsalis pedis artery pulse absence. Blood biochemistry emphasized hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, metabolic acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, iPTH values above upper limits. The X-ray of right shin highlighted a vascular calcification with a "train track" aspect on the tibial-peroneal artery trunk and the thoracic X-ray (performed with low ray regime) showed calcium deposits in coronary arteries walls. Legs arteriography and coronary angiography were performed revealing multiple lesions on investigated vessels with an 80% narrowing of right coronary artery. The particularity of the case lies in the absence of angina in a chronic hemodialysis patient in whom multiple significant angiographically stenosis of the coronary arteries were found and successful endovascular therapy was performed.Conclusion.The broadening of the indication for coronary angiography should be considered in certain asymptomatic CKD stage 5D patients based on a risk score involving calcium, phosphate, PTH and acid-base imbalances, while considering their major influence on the structure and tone of vascular walls thus on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates.Abbreviations.ABI = ankle-brachial index,CAD = coronary artery disease,CKD = chronic kidney disease,CT = computed tomography, EBCT = electron-beam computed tomography,ESRD = end-stage renal disease,GFR = glomerular filtration rate,iPTH = intact parathormon,PCI = percutaneous coronary intervention.},

Clinicians should exclude pseudoresistant hypertension, which results from nonadherence to medications or from elevated blood pressure related to the white coat syndrome. In patients with truly resistant hypertension, thiazide diuretics, particularly chlorthalidone, should be considered as one of the initial agents. The other 2 agents should include calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for cardiovascular protection. An increasing body of evidence has suggested benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as eplerenone and spironolactone, in improving blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of circulating aldosterone levels. Thus, this class of drugs should be considered for patients whose blood pressure remains elevated after treatment with a 3-drug regimen to maximal or near maximal doses. Resistant hypertension may be associated with secondary causes of hypertension including obstructive sleep apnea or primary aldosteronism. Treating these disorders can significantly improve blood pressure beyond medical therapy alone. The role of device therapy for treating the typical patient with resistant hypertension remains unclear.},

The case is the first NFNS patient reported in the literature who was diagnosed to have GHD and who received GH treatment until reaching final height.

The urologist performed testicular sperm extraction (TESE). There were selected nine sperm cells by intra-cytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI). For this purpose, we used an inverted microscope with high magnification equipped with ×60 air objectives with modulation contrast illumination. After intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of sperm into the oocytes there were obtained six normal embryos from which three embryos were transferred into the uterus. A singleton pregnancy was achieved which was completed with birth of a healthy baby in time. This successful outcome shows that use of IMSI and ICSI procedures are really useful in selection of best spermatozoa obtained by TESE in treatment of obstructive azoospermia.},

Vascular abnormalities consisted of an increased number of enlarged mitochondria in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of small arteries. Biochemical analysis showed an isolated defect of COX activity, which was only 16% of the mean control level. At the second biopsy at 44 months of age, the COX activity had increased to normal in the entire specimen. On electron microscopy, the abnormal mitochondria present on the first biopsy specimen had disappeared both in muscle fibers and blood vessels; nearly all mitochondria were morphologically normal at the second biopsy.

Most lymphoid cells were small and positive for T-cell markers. Some relatively large atypical cells were scattered in the lesion, most of which (60%) were positive for CD30. T-cell receptor-beta gene rearrangement was confirmed in the abdominal lesion. MGC infiltrated more dominantly into a deeeper layer of the skin with the elastic fibres there almost completely disappearing. Immunoreactivity for CD30 of MGC was negative and overexpression of elastolytic metalloproteinases was observed.

    abstract = {The adductor canal compression syndrome is one of the several rare nontraumatic causes of arterial occlusions, which may lead to critical ischemia of the lower limb. We report the case of a 46-year-old athletic woman, who suffered from activity-related paresthesia and sharp pain in the left upper and lower leg for 2 years. Imaging and neurological investigations of the spine remained without pathological findings that would explain the patient's complaints. Actually, the patient presented with symptoms of critical lower limb ischemia. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed nearly complete thrombotic occlusion of the common femoral artery and the arteries of the lower leg. An emergency surgery was performed, revealing an external compression of the superficial femoral artery in the adductor canal. Subsequently, a thrombectomy was performed and a venous bypass graft was installed. No postoperative complications occurred, the patient recovered well and could return to her activities of daily living about 3 weeks after the surgery. The adductor canal compression syndrome results from a local anomalous musculotendinous band or hypertrophic musculature surrounding the passing structures. It mainly occurs in athletes exposed to repetitive stress, especially runners and skiers, and may lead to thrombosis followed by critical lower extremity ischemia. The lack of obvious symptoms during routine physical examination often impedes rapid diagnosis and timely therapy. Considering the high thrombotic risk, attention should be paid to this rare cause of lower limb pain to prevent the patient from critical lower extremity ischemia and potential limb loss due to consecutive acute thrombotic occlusions.},

A 51-year-old man presented with two weeks of acid reflux and a 35-lb weight loss. Laboratory data were notable for transaminitis and AFP was 2524 ng/mL. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed abnormal thickening of the esophagus and multiple metastatic masses throughout the liver. Biopsy of one of the masses revealed adenocarcinoma of gastrointestinal origin. Subsequent upper endoscopy revealed an esophageal mass with biopsy notable for ulcerated dysplastic glandular mucosa with likely underlying malignancy. The patient underwent palliative esophageal stent placement but died two months later. Elevated AFP levels are an unusual occurrence in EAC. Prognosis is poor given its advanced presenting stage and high metastatic potential. Most cases are unsuccessfully treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Serial measurement of serum AFP may be useful for monitoring clinical status and treatment response. Clinicians should consider AFP-producing EAC in their differential diagnosis in the work-up of a liver mass in the setting of elevated AFP or liver function impairment, especially in the absence of chronic liver disease.},

The lesions responded well to CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, oncovin, prednisone) chemotherapy, but relapsed shortly after therapy. The patient was surviving with the disease for eight years but was ultimately lost to follow up. Histopathologically, the neoplasm evolved from IL to extravascular lymphoma.

We identified a proband with syndromic hypomaturation enamel defects caused by a homozygous C to T transition (g.232598C>T c.1276C>T p.Arg426Cys) in STIM1, and a proband with isolated hypomaturation enamel defects caused by a homozygous C to T transition (g.124552C>T; c.437C>T; p.Ala146Val) in SLC24A4. Immunohistochemistry of developing mouse molars and incisors showed positive STIM1 and SLC24A4 signal specifically in maturation-stage ameloblasts. We conclude that enamel maturation is dependent upon STIM1 and SLC24A4 function, and that there are important differences in the Ca(2+) transcellular transport systems used by secretory- and maturation-stage ameloblasts.},

    abstract = {Primary carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation caused by defective carnitine transport. This disease can present early in life with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and acute metabolic decompensation, or later in life with skeletal or cardiac myopathy. Mutations abolishing the function of OCTN2, an organic cation/carnitine transporter with twelve putative transmembrane spanning domains, were recently demonstrated in patients with early- and late-onset (up to seven years of age) presentation of this syndrome. Most of the reported mutations are null alleles. Here we evaluate the OCTN2 gene in a male patient who presented at seven years of age with severe dilated cardiomyopathy. Plasma carnitine levels were undetectable and carnitine transport by his fibroblasts was reduced to about 3% of normal controls. This patient was homozygous for a single base pair change in exon 8 of the OCTN2 gene (1354G>A) converting the codon for Glu 452 to Lys (E452K) in the predicted intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 10 and 11. Stable expression of the mutant E452K-OCTN2 cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells caused a partial increase in carnitine transport to 2-4% of the levels measured in the wild type transporter. This reduced transport activity was associated with normal Km toward carnitine (3.1 +/- 1.1 microM), but markedly reduced Vmax. These results indicate that primary carnitine deficiency can be caused by mutations encoding for carnitine transporters with residual activity, and that the E452K affects a domain not involved in carnitine recognition.},

Defects in innate pathways seen with CGD, including complement systems, and toll-like and dectin receptor pathways, have not been described before. We present the case of a 2-year old male patient hospitalized with recurrent pneumonia, a non-healing skin ulcer, necrotizing lung granulomas, and epididymo-orchitis. Defective neutrophil chemiluminescence was detected by dihydrorhodamine (DHR) testing. Further evaluation demonstrated characteristic molecular mutations of CYBB consistent with CGD. Immune evaluation demonstrated polyclonal hyperglobulinemia, but a greatly reduced mannose binding lectin (MBL) level. Six biallelic polymorphisms in MBL gene and its promoter were analyzed using Light CyclerTM Real-time PCR assay. The LXPA/LYPB haplotype of MBL was detected in our patient; the latter is the defective haplotype associated with low MBL levels. Due to the implications for innate immunity and the protection against bacterial, viral, and fungal infections provided by MBL, a deficiency of this protein may have disastrous consequences on the long term outcomes of CGD. MBL deficiency can also complicate other disorders affecting the immune system, significantly increasing the risk of infection in such patients. Further studies looking at the frequency and implications of MBL deficiency in CGD are needed.},

Muscle biopsy revealed mild lipid storage. The findings of serum acyl-carnitines were consistent with CDSP manifesting as decreased free and total carnitines in serum. But oral L-carnitine supplementation was not very effective to this patient and mutation analysis of the SLC22A5 gene for CDSP was normal. Later, another acyl-carnitine analysis revealed a typical MADD profile in serum, which was characterized by increased multiple acyl-carnitines. Compound heterozygous mutations were identified in electron transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) gene which confirmed the diagnosis of MADD. After administration of riboflavin, he improved dramatically, both clinically and biochemically. Thus, late onset riboflavin-responsive MADD should be included in the differential diagnosis for adult carnitine deficiency.},

In the present paper we report a case of acute hepatitis with lymphocytic destructive cholangitis on liver biopsy. Clinical and biological examinations showed that the patient had hepatitis E with no other cause of liver disease.

This entity presents vascular changes in the form of smooth muscle degeneration with swollen myocytes and PAS-positive granular deposits, together with vascular fibrosis and hyalinization. In parallel, diffuse white matter destruction with infarcts, tissue rarefaction, spongiosis, lacunes and demyelination are characteristic. Ultrastructurally, vascular granular osmiophilic material (GOM) is pathognomonic for this hereditary disease caused by NOTCH3 mutation. We diagnosed CADASIL in the autopsy examination of a 53-year-old woman with a 9-year history of a progressive neurological disease with complex motor and cognitive deficits, accompanied by non-specific diffuse white matter changes on neuroimaging. Despite several multicentre hospitalizations, the precise diagnosis was not established until the post-mortem examination of the brain was made. CADASIL is a rare entity, but it should be considered by a pathologist in a differential diagnosis of vascular diseases of the brain, especially in cases with atypical clinical presentation and familial history. The prompt diagnosis depends on the quality of the brain autopsy and proper sampling. The post mortem examination, where “Morituri vivos docent”, is still significant.},

We present a multicenter retrospective review of all cases that used absorbable antibiotic-impregnated beads for complex wound management from 2003 to 2013. A total of 104 cases were investigated, flap coverage was used in 97 cases (93.3%). Overall, 15 patients (14.4%) required reoperation with the highest groups involving orthopedic wounds and sternal wounds.

The cells, plated at 10(6) per cm2 onto four Nuclepore filters coated with human placental collagen, formed confluent monolayers after 1 day. Their ultrastructure was similar to that of normal human cells. They were studied in conventional Ussing chambers or with intracellular microelectrodes on days 5-7 after plating. The monolayers displayed resistance of 380 +/- 50 omega X cm2 and short-circuit current (Isc) of 1.8 +/- 0.4 microA X cm-2. This resistance is similar to that obtained for dog or normal human monolayers. The Isc is less than normal human (approximately 3 microA X cm-2) or dog (approximately 10 microA X cm-2) cells. The cystic fibrosis cells resembled normal monolayers in that serosal ouabain and mucosal amiloride inhibited Isc, while mucosal ouabain or serosal amiloride had no effect. They differed from normal human or dog cells in that Isc was not inhibited by bumetanide and the stimulation of Isc by isoproterenol or prostaglandin E2 was greatly reduced or abolished. Addition of isoproterenol depolarized apical membrane potential (psi a) and decreased fractional resistance (fR) in normal human and dog but had no effect on psi a or fR in cystic fibrosis cells. Reduction of mucosal chloride from 120 to 5 mM by replacement with gluconate increased fR of dog and normal human monolayers and depolarized psi a by 22 (dog) or 30 (human) mV. In cystic fibrosis monolayers, chloride replacement hyperpolarized psi a by 2 mV and had little effect on fR. These results suggest that the primary defect in cystic fibrosis is reduced apical membrane chloride conductance.},

Plexiform neurofibromas are the most common type of tumors seen in neurofibromatosis type 1. Approximately 50% occur in the head and neck region with a 5% incidence of airway involvement. We describe the case of a 5 month old with a plexiform neurofibroma of the neck who developed complete airway obstruction on induction of anesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a skull base neurofibroma extending to the hypopharynx and resulting in deviation of the airway. Because of the possibility of airway involvement, a careful preanesthetic evaluation as well as a slow induction with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be considered in patients presenting with facial neurofibromas.},

Fetal hypokinesia, secondary to a variety of genetic conditions, neuromuscular disorders, and environmental agents, is associated with contractures. In order to increase our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with SURF 1 deficiency, a common cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV deficiency and Leigh syndrome, we describe a now 6-year-old boy who presented in the neonatal period with amyoplasia congenita. His development was normal until age 10.5 months, at which time he developed severe hypotonia and choreoathetosis following an episode of viral gastroenteritis. Following the onset of neurological symptoms, he gradually developed severe kyphosis and lower limb contractures. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were elevated and head imaging showed characteristic features of Leigh syndrome. He was found to harbor two pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the SURF 1 gene. In this case, mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant energy deficiency may have played a role in causing abnormal neuronal development during embryogenesis, causing arthrogryposis. A variety of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies have been associated with contractures of varying severity. Therefore, mitochondrial disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal arthrogryposis, especially if other characteristic findings such as lactic acidemia or basal ganglia abnormalities are present.},

Here, we report on a woman with a novel mutation in CYBB (CCG[90-92]-->GGT), predicting Tyr30Arg31-->stop, Val in gp91phox, who presented with clinical symptoms at the age of 66. The mutation was present in heterozygous form in genomic DNA from her leukocytes but was fully expressed in mRNA from these cells, indicating that in her leukocytes the X chromosome carrying the nonmutated CYBB allele had been inactivated. Indeed, only 0.4% to 2% of her neutrophils showed NADPH oxidase activity. This extreme skewing of her X-chromosome inactivation was not found in her cheek mucosal cells and is thus not due to a general defect in gene methylation on one X chromosome. Moreover, the CYBB mutation was not present in the DNA from her cheek cells and was barely detectable in the DNA from her memory T lymphocytes. Thus, this patient shows a somatic mosaic for the CYBB mutation, which probably originated during her lifetime in her bone marrow.},

He did not experience metabolic crises between ages 4-12 years. He experienced recurrent vomiting, mild hyperammonemia, and generalized weakness associated with acute illnesses and growth spurts. At age 18 years, he developed exercise intolerance and proximal muscle weakness leading to the identification of multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and complex II/III deficiencies in both skeletal muscle and liver. Subsequent molecular characterization of the ETFDH gene revealed novel heterozygous mutations, p.G274X:c.820 G > T (exon 7) and p.P534L: c.1601 C > T (exon 12), the latter within the iron sulfur-cluster and predicted to affect ubiquinone reductase activity of ETFDH and the docking of ETF to ETFDH.

Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple tyrosine kinase receptors. This drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for the treatment of clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We describe a 65-year-old woman who was treated with sunitinib for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. After 5 months of therapy, she developed acute heart failure requiring hospitalization; sunitinib was immediately discontinued. The patient had classic symptoms of heart failure, including pleural effusion. An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She received standard treatment for heart failure, including a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and diuretics. Within 1 month, the patient's symptoms resolved, and subsequent cardiac evaluation showed that her left ventricular ejection fraction returned to normal. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events developed by the National Cancer Institute, her cardiac event associated with sunitinib was defined as grade III toxicity. One month later, sorafenib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was started with the aim of continuing her previous response to sunitinib. After 7 months of sorafenib therapy, the patient had no evidence of heart failure, and her condition was responding to treatment. Clinicians should be aware that sunitinib-induced heart failure occurs occultly and that many--but not all--cases resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Use of sorafenib after sunitinib-induced heart failure appears to be safe and effective, which suggests that cardiotoxicity is not a general class effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors.},

Subsequent investigations for an underlying cause of the two episodes of venous thrombosis revealed a total homocysteine level of >350 μmol/L (<15 μmol/L). An underlying diagnosis of homocystinuria secondary to cystathionine β-synthase deficiency was made although this metabolic condition is normally recognised in childhood.

Comprehensive cytoreductive surgery was performed. The ovarian tumor was an endometrioid adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation. There were diffuse brownish flecks over the omental surface and pelvic peritoneum, which contained fragments of degenerated squamous cells, keratin, and numerous foreign body giant cells. Extensive multiple sections were examined for these implants. DNA flow cytometry and various immunostaining studies (HER-2/neu, p53, CK-7, and cytokeratin [AE1/AE3]) were performed. Since viable epithelial cells in the implants could be differentially identified against mesothelial or granulomatous components by CK-7 staining and DNA aneuploidy was demonstrated on primary ovarian tumor, four courses of chemotherapy were administered.

The disorder is characterized by low blood levels of estrogens, androgens and cortisol, which leads to a compensatory increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels that stimulate the production of mineralocorticoid precursors. This subsequently leads to hypertension, hypokalemia, primary amenorrhea and sexual infantilism. Over 90 distinct genetic lesions have been identified in patients with this disorder. The prevalence of common mutation of CYP17A1 gene differs among ethnic groups. Treatment of this disorder involves replacement of glucocorticoids and sex steroids. Estrogen alone is prescribed for patients who are biologically male with 17α‑hydroxylase deficiencies that identify as female. However, genetically female patients may receive estrogen and progesterone supplementation. In the present study, a 17‑year‑old female with 17α‑hydroxylase/17,20‑lyase deficiency that presented with primary amenorrhea and sexual infantilism and no hypertension, was examined. The karyotype of the patient was 46, XX, and genetic analysis revealed the presence of a compound heterozygous mutation in exons 6 and 8, leading to the complete absence of 17α‑hydroxylase/17,20‑lyase activity. The patient was treated with prednisolone and ethinyl estradiol. In addition, a summary of the recent literature regarding CAH is presented.},

The most frequent anatomic sites were the craniofacial bones, the femur, and the tibia. Twenty-three of the 83 cases were treated with local radiation. In fibrous dysplasia, any abrupt alteration in the clinical course, manifested by pain and swelling, raises the possibility of malignant degeneration.},

In general, CD8+T cells are the predominant lymphocytes in the insulitis lesions, and CD4+T cell-dominant insulitis is very rare. We present a case of a 72-year-old woman presented with excessive thirst and a 3-month history of weight loss. She was in a state of ketosis, and her plasma glucose concentration and HbA1c value were elevated. Moreover, anti-islet autoantibodies were positive, thus acute-onset Type 1 DM was diagnosed. At the time of diagnosis, a tumour was detected in the pancreas; total pancreatectomy was carried out 2 months later. The pathological diagnosis was intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma. Immunohistochemical staining of a sample of non-tumorous pancreatic tissue revealed 13 insulitis lesions infiltrated by both CD4+and CD8+T cells, and interestingly there were more CD4+T cells than CD8+T cells in the lesions. Moreover, B cells and macrophages had also infiltrated the lesions, and these two cell frequencies were both positively correlated with CD4+as well as CD8+T cell frequencies. This was a rare case with acute-onset Type 1 DM characterized by CD4+T cell-dominant insulitis. Proinflammatory cytokines that can promote β-cell apoptosis or CD8+T cell function are reported to be secreted from CD4+T cells. Thus, together with B cells and macrophages, CD4+T cell-associated immune responses may have, directly and/or indirectly, played a role in the pathogenesis of the Type 1 DM in this patient.},

Clinical courses of 2 patients with biochemical evidence of a pancreatogenous hypoglycemia were studied. The preoperative diagnosis was multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN-1) and nesidioblastosis, respectively. Rapid intraoperative portal vein insulin assay combined with occlusion of the pancreas was used to localize and confirm complete excision of the hypersecreting tissue. Hypoglycemia was successfully treated in both the patients. In the MEN-1 patient, 2 small tumors in the head of pancreas were not resected, as they were deemed noninsulin secreting by intraoperative portal vein insulin assay, thus avoiding a total pancreatectomy. In the patient with nesidioblastosis, using intraoperative portal vein insulin assay combined with occlusion of the pancreas, an appropriate amount of pancreatic tissue was resected thereby avoiding recurrence and diabetes. This technique may be of particular value in patients with complex conditions such as MEN-1 and nesidioblastosis, to localize and achieve complete resection of hypersecreting pancreatic tissue.},

Cardiac auscultation revealed a diastolic murmur in the mitral area. Her temperature was 38.3 degrees C. On echocardiographic examination, the mitral valve area was 0.62 cm (2) and an isoechoic mass thought to be a vegetation was detected on the anterior mitral leaflet. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made and vancomycin administration was commenced. Brucella melitensis was isolated in all three blood samples, however, the patient remained seronegative with Brucella agglutination titers of up to 1/160. The antibiotic therapy was then shifted to doxycycline (200 mg/day), rifampicin (600 mg/day), and ciprofloxacin (1000 mg/day). After 30 days of treatment, surgery was performed for the severely stenotic mitral valve and to remove the vegetation. The operation was successful. The postoperative period was uneventful. On the follow-up she had no complaints.

We analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and detected a high level of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), which demonstrated the neurohypophyseal lesion to be germinoma and brought the patient from successful radiochemotherapy up to complete remission. PIR adjacent to the germinoma (PIRAG) disappeared completely following radiochemotherapy, although it contained almost no germinoma cells. Examination of the CSF-PLAP level can complement the diagnosis of germinoma and will decrease the risk of misdiagnosis.

The main symptoms of CDSP are skeletal and cardiac myopathy. CDSP is caused by a defect in plasma membrane uptake of carnitine, ultimately caused by the SLC22A5 gene. We report the case of a Korean patient with CDSP. He had an abnormal free carnitine level of 5.56 μmol/L (reference range, RR 10.4~87.1 μmol/L) and a palmitoylcarnitine level of 0.27 μmol/L (RR 0.5~9.7 μmol/L) in a newborn screening test.

After PCR-sequencing analysis of the SLC22A5 gene, the patient was found to be a compound heterozygote for c.506G>A (p.R169Q) and c.1400C>G (p.S467C) mutations. These missense mutations are reported previously. The patient was started on L-carnitine supplement after CDSP diagnosis. The patient was treated with L-carnitine to reach a normal free carnitine level and has remained asymptomatic up to the current age of 21 months. The plasma free carnitine level normalized to 66.6 μmol/L at 4 weeks after treatment.

His second magnetic resonance imaging at 2 years old revealed a symmetric T2 prolongation involving the subthalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, and medulla lesions. In the second child, at the age of 2 the first magnetic resonance imaging documented heavy brainstem and subthalamic nuclei involvement. A second magnetic resonance imaging, performed when he was 3 years old, revealed diffuse involvement of the substantia nigra and hyperintense lesions of the central tegmental tract in addition to previous lesions.

    abstract = {A young Chinese male patient was identified as homozygous for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. This patient had a 4-year medical history mainly presenting severe ataxia, abnormal eye movement and pyramidal signs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cervical spinal cord revealed no obvious abnormality despite the severe symptoms and the findings of an electromyogram. However, brainstem auditory evoked potential indicated peripheral impairment and visual evoked potential indicated central impairment of his visual pathways. Molecular diagnosis revealed the pattern of CAG repeat units of this patient was 71/71. This case demonstrates that homozygosity for MJD enhances the clinical severity of the disease, which suggests that genetic education is of great importance.},

However, there was a disease progression after these treatment regimens.The NGS revealed the presence of a copy number loss (CNL) of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), CDKN2A/B and TP53 genes.

Complete sequencing analysis of the SLC12A3 gene revealed that both the proband and his elder sister had a novel homozygous SLC12A3 mutation: c.2099T>C and p.Leu700Pro. Moreover, the SLC12A3 genes of his mother and daughter encoded the same mutated heterozygote. It was noted that in this pedigree, only the proband complained about recurrent episodes of bilateral lower limb weakness over 8 years, while his elder sister, mother and daughter did not present symptoms. The inconsistent clinical features of this pedigree implied that besides diverse phenotypes possibly originated from the same genotype, gender difference may also dominate the variant GS phenotypes. Further genetic and proteomic research are needed to investigate the precise mechanisms of GS, including the study of specific ethnicities.},

We reviewed seven cases of calcified VS that were previously reported in the literature, and we analyzed and summarized the characteristics of these tumors, including the calcification, texture, and blood supply.

Six patients who underwent contrast-enhanced sonographically guided thermal ablation for treatment of solid-organ bleeding (5 in liver and 1 in spleen) from December 2005 to August 2012 were included in this series. Clinical information, contrast-enhanced sonograms before and after ablation, and the ablation method were retrospectively collected and analyzed. In 5 of the 6 patients, the location of the bleeding lesion was clearly seen. Hemostasis was successfully achieved in 4 of these 5 patients: 1 by radiofrequency ablation and 3 by microwave ablation. Ablation failed to achieve hemostasis in 1 patient who had postbiopsy splenic arterial bleeding because the bleeding vessel was a thick branch of the splenic artery. In the sixth remaining patient, who had bleeding after liver biopsy, hemostasis failed because contrast-enhanced sonography did not precisely locate the bleeding lesion; hence, the ablation zone did not cover the whole lesion. Contrast-enhanced sonographically guided ablation can be an alternative choice for treating solid-organ bleeding because of its effectiveness and minimal invasiveness. However, it should be carefully investigated for those in whom the bleeding lesion cannot be located by contrast-enhanced sonography and in those who have bleeding in a large vessel.},

Magnetic resonance imaging showed mild basilar invagination and impression. Although unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia and osteogenesis imperfecta may have been coincidental diagnoses, we propose possible mechanisms for unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia secondary to osteogenesis imperfecta. For example, cerebellar hypoplasia may have been because of vascular disruption or direct compression to the posterior circulation in utero. Foetuses with osteogenesis imperfecta are more susceptible to the above risks compared to the normal foetus because of associated craniocervical anomalies and a poorly ossified skull.},

Following carnitine supplementation, the patient's regression ended, and the boy started gaining developmental milestones. This case report suggests that deficits in carnitine biosynthesis may be responsible for some cases of regression in individuals with ASD, and that testing for the respective biochemical pathway should be considered. Furthermore, this case suggests that carnitine supplementation may be useful in treating (and potentially preventing) regressive episodes in patients with carnitine deficiency. Further work to better define the role of disorders of carnitine biosynthesis in autism spectrum disorder is warranted.},

CASE REPORT A 47-year-old nonsmoking Hispanic man with advanced HIV infection presented with severe acute necrotizing pneumonia secondary to R. equi. Although his initial response to antimicrobial therapy was optimal, he became symptomatic again in spite of continuation of antibiotics as he developed severe paradoxical IRIS 3 weeks after starting a new highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of IRIS remains challenging because of the wide variations in the clinical presentation and etiologies. In spite of its rarity as an opportunistic pathogen, we recommend that R. equi, an intracellular pathogen, be included in the differential list of pathogens associated with IRIS.},

PSC-IBD warrants regular dysplasia-surveillance colonoscopy. However, no consensus exists regarding follow-up colonoscopy in PSC patients without IBD who remain asymptomatic. We describe a 43-year-old female who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) due to advanced PSC. Previous colonoscopies had been normal. The post-transplantation course was uneventful, with no rejections and signs of PSC recurrence. Immunosuppression was by tacrolimus monotherapy. She was asymptomatic with normal inflammation markers. A protocol colonoscopy, performed as general dysplasia surveillance 8 years post-transplantation, revealed mucopurulent-covered small superficial ulcerations and erythema diffusely distributed from the cecal to sigmoid colon with intervening normal mucosa and rectal sparing. Histologic examination showed patchy chronic colitis with crypt architectural distortion and mild-moderate inflammation activity. Infection samples were negative. Findings complied with de novo IBD, type unclassified. In conclusion, the link between PSC and clinically silent IBD may manifest after the PSC diagnosis and even several years after LT. Given the increased colorectal cancer risk associated with PSC, IBD, and LT, repeat colonoscopy might be warranted in PSC patients without IBD at initial assessment, and also after LT.},
